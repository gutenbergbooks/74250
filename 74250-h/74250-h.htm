  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This little volume is an attempt at a brief exposition of the
philosophical and religious doctrines found in Patañjali’s
<cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite> as explained by its successive commentaries of
Vyāsa, Vācaspati, Vijñāna Bhikshu, and others. The exact
date of Patañjali cannot be definitely ascertained, but if his
identity with the other Patañjali, the author of the Great
Commentary (<cite>Mahābhāshya</cite>) on Pāṇini’s grammar, could be
conclusively established, there would be some evidence in
our hands that he lived in 150 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> I have already discussed
this subject in the first volume of my <cite>A History of Indian
Philosophy</cite>, where the conclusion to which I arrived was that,
while there was some evidence in favour of their identity,
there was nothing which could be considered as being conclusively
against it. The term Yoga, according to Patañjali’s
definition, means the final annihilation (<i>nirodha</i>) of all the
mental states (<i>cittavṛtti</i>) involving the preparatory stages in
which the mind has to be habituated to being steadied into
particular types of graduated mental states. This was actually
practised in India for a long time before Patañjali lived; and
it is very probable that certain philosophical, psychological,
and practical doctrines associated with it were also current
long before Patañjali. Patañjali’s work is, however, the
earliest systematic compilation on the subject that is known
to us. It is impossible, at this distance of time, to determine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>the extent to which Patañjali may claim originality. Had it
not been for the labours of the later commentators, much of
what is found in Patañjali’s aphorisms would have remained
extremely obscure and doubtful, at least to all those who were
not associated with such ascetics as practised them, and who
derived the theoretical and practical knowledge of the subject
from their preceptors in an upward succession of generations
leading up to the age of Patañjali, or even before him. It is
well to bear in mind that Yoga is even now practised in India,
and the continuity of traditional instruction handed down
from teacher to pupil is not yet completely broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>If anyone wishes methodically to pursue a course which
may lead him ultimately to the goal aimed at by Yoga, he
must devote his entire life to it under the strict practical
guidance of an advanced teacher. The present work can in
no sense be considered as a practical guide for such purposes.
But it is also erroneous to think—as many uninformed people
do—that the only interest of Yoga lies in its practical side.
The philosophical, psychological, cosmological, ethical, and
religious doctrines, as well as its doctrines regarding matter
and change, are extremely interesting in themselves, and have
a definitely assured place in the history of the progress of
human thought; and, for a right understanding of the
essential features of the higher thoughts of India, as well
as of the practical side of Yoga, their knowledge is indispensable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Yoga doctrines taught by Patañjali are regarded as
the highest of all Yogas (<i>Rājayoga</i>), as distinguished from
other types of Yoga practices, such as <i>Haṭhayoga</i> or <i>Mantrayoga</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Of these <i>Haṭhayoga</i> consists largely of a system of
bodily exercises for warding off diseases, and making the body
fit for calmly bearing all sorts of physical privations and physical
strains. <i>Mantrayoga</i> is a course of meditation on certain
mystical syllables which leads to the audition of certain
mystical sounds. This book does not deal with any of these
mystical practices nor does it lay any stress on the performance
of any of those miracles described by Patañjali. The scope of
this work is limited to a brief exposition of the intellectual
foundation—or the theoretical side—of the Yoga practices,
consisting of the philosophical, psychological, cosmological,
ethical, religious, and other doctrines which underlie these
practices. The affinity of the system of Sāṃkhya thought,
generally ascribed to a mythical sage, Kapila, to that of
Yoga of Patañjali is so great on most important points of
theoretical interest that they may both be regarded as two
different modifications of one common system of ideas. I
have, therefore, often taken the liberty of explaining Yoga
ideas by a reference to kindred ideas in Sāṃkhya. But the
doctrines of Yoga could very well have been compared or
contrasted with great profit with the doctrines of other
systems of Indian thought. This has purposely been omitted
here as it has already been done by me in my <cite>Yoga Philosophy
in relation to other Systems of Indian Thought</cite>, the publication
of which has for long been unavoidably delayed. All that may
be expected from the present volume is that it will convey to
the reader the essential features of the Yoga system of
thought. How far this expectation will be realized from this
book it will be for my readers to judge. It is hoped that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>chapter on “Kapila and Pātañjala School of Sāṃkhya” in my
<cite>A History of Indian Philosophy</cite> (Vol. I. Cambridge University
Press, 1922) will also prove helpful for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am deeply indebted to my friend Mr. Douglas Ainslie
for the numerous corrections and suggestions regarding the
English style that he was pleased to make throughout the
body of the manuscript and the very warm encouragement
that he gave me for the publication of this work. In this
connection I also beg to offer my best thanks for the valuable
suggestions which I received from the reviser of the press.
Had it not been for these, the imperfections of the book would
have been still greater. The quaintness and inelegance of
some of my expressions would, however, be explained if it
were borne in mind that here, as well as in my <cite>A History of
Indian Philosophy</cite>, I have tried to resist the temptation of
making the English happy at the risk of sacrificing the
approach to exactness of the philosophical sense; and many
ideas of Indian philosophy are such that an exact English
rendering of them often becomes hopelessly difficult.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am grateful to my friend and colleague, Mr. D. K. Sen, <span class='fss'>M.A.</span>,
for the kind assistance that he rendered in helping me to
prepare the index.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last of all, I must express my deep sense of gratefulness
to Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee, Kt., C.S.I., etc. etc., and the
University of Calcutta, for kindly permitting me to utilize
my <cite>A Study of Patañjāli</cite>, which is a Calcutta University
publication, for the present work.</p>

<p class='c006'>However dogmatic a system of philosophical enquiry may
appear to us, it must have been preceded by a criticism of
the observed facts of experience. The details of the criticism
and the processes of self-argumentation by which the thinker
arrived at his theory of the Universe might indeed be suppressed,
as being relatively unimportant, but a thoughtful
reader would detect them as lying in the background behind
the shadow of the general speculations, but at the same time
setting them off before our view. An Aristotle or a Patañjali
may not make any direct mention of the arguments which led
him to a dogmatic assertion of his theories, but for a reader
who intends to understand them thoroughly it is absolutely
necessary that he should read them in the light as far as possible
of the inferred presuppositions and inner arguments of
their minds; it is in this way alone that he can put himself
in the same line of thinking with the thinker whom he is
willing to follow, and can grasp him to the fullest extent.
In offering this short study of the Pātañjala metaphysics,
I shall therefore try to supplement it with such of my inferences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of the presuppositions of Patañjali’s mind, which
I think will add to the clearness of the exposition of his views,
though I am fully alive to the difficulties of making such
inferences about a philosopher whose psychological, social,
religious and moral environments differed so widely from ours.</p>

<p class='c007'>An enquiry into the relations of the mental phenomena
to the physical has sometimes given the first start to philosophy.
The relation of mind to matter is such an important
problem of philosophy that the existing philosophical systems
may roughly be classified according to the relative importance
that has been attached to mind or to matter. There have
been chemical, mechanical and biological conceptions which
have ignored mind as a separate entity and have dogmatically
affirmed it to be the product of matter only.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> There have
been theories of the other extreme, which have dispensed
with matter altogether and have boldly affirmed that matter
as such has no reality at all, and that thought is the only
thing which can be called Real in the highest sense. All
matter as such is non-Being or Māyā or Avidyā. There have
been Nihilists like the Śūnyavādi Buddhists who have gone
so far as to assert that neither matter nor mind exists. Some
have asserted that matter is only thought externalized, some
have regarded the principle of matter as the unknowable
Thing-in-itself, some have regarded them as separate
independent entities held within a higher reality called God,
or as two of his attributes only, and some have regarded
their difference as being only one of grades of intelligence,
one merging slowly and imperceptibly into the other and
held together in concord with each other by pre-established
harmony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Underlying the metaphysics of the Yoga system of thought
as taught by Patañjali and as elaborated by his commentators
we find an acute analysis of matter and thought. Matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>on the one hand, mind, the senses, and the ego on the other
are regarded as nothing more than two different kinds of
modifications of one primal cause, the Prakṛti. But the self-intelligent
principle called Purusha (spirit) is distinguished
from them. Matter consists only of three primal qualities
or rather substantive entities, which he calls the Sattva or
intelligence-stuff, Rajas or energy, and Tamas—the factor of
obstruction or mass or inertia. It is extremely difficult
truly to conceive of the nature of these three kinds of entities
or Guṇas, as he calls them, when we consider that these
three elements alone are regarded as composing all phenomena,
mental and physical. In order to comprehend them rightly
it will be necessary to grasp thoroughly the exact relation
between the mental and the physical. What are the real
points of agreement between the two? How can the same
elements be said to behave in one case as the conceiver and
in the other case as the conceived? Thus Vācaspati says:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The reals (guṇas) have two forms, viz. the determiner or
the perceiver, and the perceived or the determined. In the
aspect of the determined or the perceived, the guṇas evolve
themselves as the five infra-atomic potentials, the five gross
elements and their compounds. In the aspect of perceiver or
determiner, they form the modifications of the ego together
with the senses.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to notice here the two words used by
Vācaspati in characterising the twofold aspect of the guṇa
viz. <i>vyavasāyātmakatva</i>, their nature as the determiner or
perceiver, and <i>vyavaseyātmakatva</i>, their nature as determined
or perceived. The elements which compose the phenomena
of the objects of perception are the same as those which form
the phenomena of the perceiving; their only distinction is
that one is the determined and the other is the determiner.
What we call the psychosis involving intellection, sensing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the ego, and what may be called the infra-atoms, atoms and
their combinations, are but two different types of modifications
of the same stuff of reals. There is no intrinsic difference
in nature between the mental and the physical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of causal transformation is explained by Vijñāna
Bhikshu in his commentary on the system of Sāṃkhya as if
its functions consisted only in making manifest what was
already there in an unmanifested form. Thus he says,
“just as the image already existing in the stone is only
manifested by the activity of the statuary, so the causal
activity also generates only that activity by which an effect
is manifested as if it happened or came into being at the
present moment.”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> The effects are all always existent, but
some of them are sometimes in an unmanifested state. What
the causal operation, viz. the energy of the agent and the
suitable collocating instruments and conditions, does is to set
up an activity by which the effect may be manifested at
the present moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>With Sāṃkhya-Yoga, sattva, rajas and tamas are substantive
entities which compose the reality of the mental and the
physical.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The mental and the physical represent two
different orders of modifications, and one is not in any way
superior to the other. As the guṇas conjointly form the manifold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>without, by their varying combinations, as well as all the
diverse internal functions, faculties and phenomena, they are
in themselves the absolute potentiality of all things, mental
and physical. Thus Vyāsa in describing the nature of the
knowable, writes: “The nature of the knowable is now
described:—The knowable, consisting of the objects of enjoyment
and liberation, as the gross elements and the perceptive
senses, is characterised by three essential traits—illumination,
energy and inertia. The sattva is of the nature
of illumination. Rajas is of the nature of energy. Inertia
(tamas) is of the nature of inactivity. The guṇa entities
with the above characteristics are capable of being modified
by mutual influence on one another, by their proximity.
They are evolving. They have the characteristics of conjunction
and separation. They manifest forms by one lending
support to the others by proximity. None of these loses its
distinct power into those of the others, even though any one
of them may exist as the principal factor of a phenomenon with
the others as subsidiary thereto. The guṇas forming the
three classes of substantive entities manifest themselves
as such by their similar kinds of power. When any one of
them plays the rôle of the principal factor of any phenomenon,
the others also show their presence in close contact. Their
existence as subsidiary energies of the principal factor is
inferred by their distinct and independent functioning, even
though it be as subsidiary qualities.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The Yoga theory does
not acknowledge qualities as being different from substances.
The ultimate substantive entities are called guṇas, which
as we have seen are of three kinds. The guṇa entities are
infinite in number; each has an individual existence, but
is always acting in co-operation with others. They may be
divided into three classes in accordance with their similarities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>of behaviour (śīla). Those which behave in the way of
intellection are called <i>sattva</i>, those which behave in the way
of producing effort of movement are called <i>rajas</i>, and those
which behave differently from these and obstruct their
process are called <i>tamas</i>. We have spoken above of a primal
cause <i>prakṛti</i>. But that is not a separate category independent
of the guṇas. Prakṛti is but a name for the guṇa entities
when they exist in a state of equilibrium. All that exists
excepting the purushas are but the guṇa entities in different
kinds of combination amongst themselves. The effects they
produce are not different from them but it is they themselves
which are regarded as causes in one state and effects in another.
The difference of combination consists in this, that in some
combinations there are more of sattva entities than rajas or
tamas, and in others more of rajas or more of tamas. These
entities are continually uniting and separating. But though
they are thus continually dividing and uniting in new combinations
the special behaviour or feature of each class of
entities remains ever the same. Whatever may be the nature
of any particular combination the sattva entities participating
in it will retain their intellective functions, rajas their energy
functions, and tamas the obstructing ones. But though
they retain their special features in spite of their mutual
difference they hold fast to one another in any particular
combination (<i>tulyajātīyātulyajātīyaśaktibhedānupātinaḥ</i>, which
Bhikshu explains as <i>aviśesheṇopashṭambhakasvabhāvāḥ</i>). In
any particular combination it is the special features of those
entities which predominate that manifest themselves, while
the other two classes lend their force in drawing the minds of
perceivers to it as an object as a magnet draws a piece of iron.
Their functionings at this time are undoubtedly feeble
(<i>sūkshmavṛttimantaḥ</i>) but still they do exist.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the three guṇas, none of them can be held as the goal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of the others. All of them are equally important, and the very
varied nature of the manifold represents only the different
combinations of these guṇas as substantive entities. In any
combination one of the guṇas may be more predominant
than the others, but the other guṇas are also present there
and perform their functions in their own way. No one of
them is more important than the other, but they serve conjointly
one common purpose, viz. the experiences and the
liberation of the purusha, or spirit. They are always uniting,
separating and re-uniting again and there is neither beginning
nor end of this (<i>anyonyamithunāḥ sarvve naishāmādisamprayogo
viprayogo vā upalabhyate</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>They have no purpose of their own to serve, but they all are
always evolving, as Dr. Seal says, “ever from a relatively less
differentiated, less determinate, less coherent whole, to a
relatively more differentiated, more determinate, more coherent
whole”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> for the experiences and liberation of purusha,
or spirit. When in a state of equilibrium they cannot serve
the purpose of the purusha, so that state of the guṇas is not
for the sake of the purusha; it is its own independent eternal
state. All the other three stages of evolution, viz. the liṅga
(sign), aviśesha (unspecialised) and viśesha (specialised) have
been caused for the sake of the purusha.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Thus Vyāsa
writes:—<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “The objects of the purusha are no cause of the
original state (<i>aliṅga</i>). That is to say, the fulfilment of the
objects of the purusha is not the cause which brings about the
manifestation of the original state of prakṛti in the beginning.
The fulfilment of the objects of the purusha is not therefore the
reason of the existence of that ultimate state. Since it is not
brought into existence by the need of the fulfilment of the
purusha’s objects it is said to be eternal. As to the three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>specialised states, the fulfilment of the objects of the purusha
becomes the cause of their manifestation in the beginning.
The fulfilment of the objects of the purusha is not therefore
the reason for the existence of the cause. Since it is not
brought into existence by the purusha’s objects it is said to be
eternal. As to the three specialised states, the fulfilment of
the objects of the purusha being the cause of their manifestation
in the beginning, they are said to be non-eternal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vācaspati again says:—“The fulfilment of the objects
of the purusha could be said to be the cause of the original
state, if that state could bring about the fulfilment of the
objects of the purusha, such as the enjoyment of sound, etc.,
or manifest the discrimination of the distinction between
true self and other phenomena. If however it did that, it
could not be a state of equilibrium,” (<i>yadyaliṅgāvasthā
śabdādyupabhogam vā sattvapurushānyatākhyātim vā purushārtham
nirvarttayet tannrvarttane hi na sāmyavasthā syāt</i>).
This state is called the prakṛti. It is the beginning, indeterminate,
unmediated and undetermined. It neither exists
nor does it not exist, but is the principium of almost all
existence. Thus Vyāsa describes it as “the state which neither
is nor is not; that which exists and yet does not; that in
which there is no non-existence; the unmanifested, the
noumenon (lit. without any manifested indication), the
background of all” (<i>niḥsattāsattam niḥsadasat nirasat
avyaktam aliṅgam pradhānam</i>).<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Vācaspati explains it as
follows:—“Existence consists in possessing the capacity
of effecting the fulfilment of the objects of the purusha.
Non-existence means a mere imaginary trifle (e.g. the horn of
a hare).” It is described as being beyond both these states
of existence and non-existence. The state of the equipoise
of the three guṇas of intelligence-stuff, inertia and energy, is
nowhere of use in fulfilling the objects of the purusha. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>therefore does not exist as such. On the other hand, it does
not admit of being rejected as non-existent like an imaginary
lotus of the sky. It is therefore not non-existent. But even
allowing the force of the above arguments about the want
of phenomenal existence of prakṛti on the ground that it
cannot serve the objects of the purusha, the difficulty arises
that the principles of Mahat, etc., exist in the state of the
unmanifested also, because nothing that exists can be destroyed;
and if it is destroyed, it cannot be born again,
because nothing that does not exist can be born; it follows
therefore that since the principles of mahat, etc., exist in the
state of the unmanifested, that state can also affect the fulfilment
of the objects of the purusha. How then can it be
said that the unmanifested is not possessed of existence? For
this reason, he describes it as that in which it exists and does
not exist. This means that the cause exists in that state in a
potential form but not in the form of the effect. Although
the effect exists in the cause as mere potential power, yet it is
incapable of performing the function of fulfilling the objects
of the purusha; it is therefore said to be non-existent as such.
Further he says that this cause is not such, that its effect is of
the nature of hare’s horn. It is beyond the state of non-existence,
that is, of the existence of the effect as mere nothing.
If it were like that, then it would be like the lotus of the sky
and no effect would follow.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But as Bhikshu points out (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, II. 18) this
prakṛti is not simple substance, for it is but the guṇa reals.
It is simple only in the sense that no complex qualities are
manifested in it. It is the name of the totality of the guṇa
reals existing in a state of equilibrium through their mutual
counter opposition. It is a hypothetical state of the guṇas
preceding the states in which they work in mutual co-operation
for the creation of the cosmos for giving the purushas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>a chance for ultimate release attained through a full enjoyment
of experiences. Some European scholars have
often asked me whether the prakṛti were real or whether the
guṇas were real. This question, in my opinion, can only arise
as a result of confusion and misapprehension, for it is the
guṇas in a state of equilibrium that are called prakṛti. Apart
from guṇas there is no prakṛti (<i>guṇā eva prakṛtiśabdavācyā
na tu tadatiriktā prakṛtirasti. Yoga-vārttika</i>, II. 18). In this
state, the different guṇas only annul themselves and no
change takes place, though it must be acknowledged that the
state of equipoise is also one of tension and action, which,
however, being perfectly balanced does not produce any
change. This is what is meant by evolution of similars
(<i>adṛśapariṇāma</i>). Prakṛti as the equilibrium of the three
guṇas is the absolute ground of all the mental and phenomenal
modifications—pure potentiality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Veṅkaṭa, a later Vaishṇava writer, describes prakṛti as one
ubiquitous, homogeneous matter which evolves itself into all
material productions by condensation and rarefaction. In
this view the guṇas would have to be translated as three
different classes of qualities or characters, which are found
in the evolutionary products of the prakṛti. This will of
course be an altogether different view of the prakṛti from that
which is described in the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, and the guṇas could
not be considered as reals or as substantive entities in such an
interpretation. A question arises, then, as to which of these
two prakṛtis is the earlier conception. I confess that it is
difficult to answer it. For though the Vaishṇava view is
elaborated in later times, it can by no means be asserted that
it had not quite as early a beginning as 2nd or 3rd century B.C.
If <cite>Ahirbudhnyasamhitā</cite> is to be trusted then the <cite>Shashṭitantraśāstra</cite>
which is regarded as an authoritative Sāṃkhya work
is really a Vaishṇava work. Nothing can be definitely
stated about the nature of prakṛti in Sāṃkhya from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>meagre statement of the <cite>Kārikā</cite>. The statement in the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>
is, however, definitely in favour of the interpretation
that we have adopted, and so also the <cite>Sāṃkhya-sūtra</cite>, which
is most probably a later work. Caraka’s account of prakṛti
does not seem to be the prakṛti of <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> for here the
guṇas are not regarded as reals or substantive entities, but
as characters, and prakṛti is regarded as containing its evolutes,
mahat, etc., as its elements (<i>dhātu</i>). If Caraka’s treatment
is the earliest view of Sāṃkhya that is available to us, then
it has to be admitted that the earliest Sāṃkhya view did not
accept prakṛti as a state of the guṇas, or guṇas as substantive
entities. But the <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite>, II. 19, and the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>
support the interpretation that I have adopted here, and it
is very curious that if the Sāṃkhya view was known at the
time to be so different from it, no reference to it should have
been made. But whatever may be the original Sāṃkhya view,
both the Yoga view and the later Sāṃkhya view are quite
in consonance with my interpretation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In later Indian thinkers there had been a tendency to make
a compromise between the Vedānta and Sāṃkhya doctrines
and to identify prakṛti with the avidyā of the Vedāntists.
Thus Lokācāryya writes:—“It is called prakṛti since it is the
source of all change, it is called avidyā since it is opposed to
knowledge, it is called māyā since it is the cause of diversion
creation (<i>prakṛtirityucyate vikārotpādakatvāt avidyā jñānavirodhitvāt
māyā vicitrasṛshṭikaratvāt</i>).”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> But this is distinctly
opposed to the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> which defines avidyā as
<i>vidyāviparītaṃ jñānāntaraṃ avidyā</i>, i.e. avidyā is that other
knowledge which is opposed to right knowledge. In some of
the Upanishads, <cite>Svetāśvatara</cite> for example, we find that māyā
and prakṛti are identified and the great god is said to preside
over them (<i>māyāṃ tu prakṛtiṃ vidyāt māyinaṃ tumaheśvaraṃ</i>).
There is a description also in the Ṛgveda, X. 92, where it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>said that (<i>nāsadāsīt na sadāsīt tadānīṃ</i>), in the beginning
there was neither the “Is” nor the “Is not,” which reminds
one of the description of prakṛti (<i>niḥsattāsattaṃ</i> as that in
which there is no existence or non-existence). In this way
it may be shown from <cite>Gītā</cite> and other Sanskrit texts that an
undifferentiated, unindividuated cosmic matter as the first
principle, was often thought of and discussed from the earliest
times. Later on this idea was utilised with modifications by
the different schools of Vedāntists, the Sāṃkhyists and those
who sought to make a reconciliation between them under the
different names of prakṛti, avidyā and māyā. What avidyā
really means according to the Pātañjala system we shall see
later on; but here we see that whatever it might mean it
does not mean prakṛti according to the Pātañjala system.
<cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, IV. 13, makes mention of māyā also in a
couplet from <cite>Shashṭitantraśāstra</cite>;</p>

<p class='c007'>The real appearance of the guṇas does not come within
the line of our vision. That, however, which comes within the
line of vision is but paltry delusion and Vācaspati Miśra
explains it as follows:—Prakṛti is like the māyā but it is not
māyā. It is trifling (<i>sutucchaka</i>) in the sense that it is changing.
Just as māyā constantly changes, so the transformations
of prakṛti are every moment appearing and vanishing and
thus suffering momentary changes. Prakṛti being eternal is
real and thus different from māyā.</p>

<p class='c007'>This explanation of Vācaspati’s makes it clear that the
word māyā is used here only in the sense of illusion, and
without reference to the celebrated māyā of the Vedāntists;
and Vācaspati clearly says that prakṛti can in no sense be
called māyā, since it is real.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br> <span class='c013'>PURUSHA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We shall get a more definite notion of prakṛti as we advance
further into the details of the later transformations of the
prakṛti in connection with the purushas. The most difficult
point is to understand the nature of its connection with the
purushas. Prakṛti is a material, non-intelligent, independent
principle, and the souls or spirits are isolated, neutral, intelligent
and inactive. Then how can the one come into connection
with the other?</p>

<p class='c007'>In most systems of philosophy the same trouble has arisen
and has caused the same difficulty in comprehending it rightly.
Plato fights the difficulty of solving the unification of the idea
and the non-being and offers his participation theory; even in
Aristotle’s attempt to avoid the difficulty by his theory of
form and matter, we are not fully satisfied, though he has
shown much ingenuity and subtlety of thought in devising
the “expedient in the single conception of development.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The universe is but a gradation between the two extremes
of potentiality and actuality, matter and form. But all
students of Aristotle know that it is very difficult to understand
the true relation between form and matter, and the
particular nature of their interaction with each other, and
this has created a great divergence of opinion among his
commentators. It was probably to avoid this difficulty that
the dualistic appearance of the philosophy of Descartes had
to be reconstructed in the pantheism of Spinoza. Again we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>find also how Kant failed to bring about the relation between
noumenon and phenomenon, and created two worlds absolutely
unrelated to each other. He tried to reconcile the schism
that he effected in his <cite>Critique of Pure Reason</cite> by his
<cite>Critique of Practical Reason</cite>, and again supplemented it
with his <cite>Critique of Judgment</cite>, but met only with dubious
success.</p>

<p class='c007'>In India also this question has always been a little puzzling,
and before trying to explain the Yoga point of view, I shall
first give some of the other expedients devised for the purpose,
by the different schools of Advaita (monistic) Vedāntism.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. The reflection theory of the Vedānta holds that the
māyā is without beginning, unspeakable, mother of gross
matter, which comes in connection with intelligence, so that
by its reflection in the former we have Īśvara. The illustrations
that are given to explain it both in <cite>Siddhāntaleśa</cite><a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and in
<cite>Advaita-Brahmasiddhi</cite> are only cases of physical reflection,
viz. the reflection of the sun in water, or of the sky in water.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. The limitation theory of the Vedānta holds that the
all-pervading intelligence must necessarily be limited by mind,
etc., so of necessity it follows that “the soul” is its limitation.
This theory is illustrated by giving those common examples
in which the Ākāśa (space) though unbounded in itself is
often spoken of as belonging to a jug or limited by the jug
and as such appears to fit itself to the shape and form of the
jug and is thus called <i>ghaṭāvacchinna ākāśa</i>, i.e. space as
within the jug.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then we have a third school of Vedāntists, which seeks to
explain it in another way:—The soul is neither a reflection nor
a limitation, but just as the son of Kuntī was known as the
son of Rādhā, so the pure Brahman by his nescience is known
as the jīva, and like the prince who was brought up in the
family of a low caste, it is the pure Brahman who by his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>nescience undergoes birth and death, and by his own nescience
is again released.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Sāṃkhya-sūtra</cite> also avails itself of the same story in
IV. 1, “<i>rājaputtravattattvopadeśāt</i>,” which Vijñāna Bhikshu
explains as follows:—A certain king’s son in consequence of
his being born under the star Gaṇḍa having been expelled
from his city and reared by a certain forester remains under
the idea: “I am a forester.” Having learnt that he is alive,
a certain minister informs him. “Thou art not a forester,
thou art a king’s son.” As he, immediately having abandoned
the idea of being an outcast, betakes himself to his true royal
state, saying, “I am a king,” so too the soul realises its purity
in consequence of instruction by some good tutor, to the effect—“Thou,
who didst originate from the first soul, which
manifests itself merely as pure thought, art a portion thereof.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In another place there are two sūtras:—(1) <i>niḥsaṅge’pi
uparāgo vivekāt</i>. (2) <i>japāsphaṭikayoriva noparāgaḥ kintvabhimānaḥ</i>.
(1) Though it be associated still there is a tingeing
through non-discrimination. (2) As in the case of the hibiscus
and the crystal, there is not a tinge, but a fancy. Now it will
be seen that all these theories only show that the transcendent
nature of the union of the principle of pure intelligence is very
difficult to comprehend. Neither the reflection nor the
limitation theory can clear the situation from vagueness and
incomprehensibility, which is rather increased by their
physical illustrations, for the cit or pure intelligence cannot
undergo reflection like a physical thing, nor can it be obstructed
or limited by it. The reflection theory adduced by the <cite>Sāṃkhya-sūtra</cite>,
“<i>japāsphiṭikayoriva noparāgaḥ kintvabhimānaḥ</i>,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>is not an adequate explanation. For here the reflection
produces only a seeming redness of the colourless crystal,
which was not what was meant by the Vedāntists of the
reflection school. But here, though the metaphor is more
suitable to express the relation of purusha with the prakṛti,
the exact nature of the relation is more lost sight of than comprehended.
Let us now see how Patañjali and Vyāsa seek to
explain it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let me quote a few sūtras of Patañjali and some of the
most important extracts from the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> and try, as far as
possible, to get the correct view:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) The Ego-sense is the illusory appearance of the identity
of the power as perceiver and the power as perceived.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) The seer though pure as mere “seeing” yet perceives
the forms assumed by the psychosis (<i>buddhi</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) It is for the sake of the purusha that the being of the
knowable exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) For the emancipated person the world-phenomena
cease to exist, yet they are not annihilated since they form
a common field of experience for other individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>(5) The cause of the realisation of the natures of the knowable
and purusha in consciousness is their mutual contact.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6) Cessation is the want of mutual contact arising from the
destruction of ignorance and this is called the state of oneness.</p>

<p class='c007'>(7) This state of oneness arises out of the equality in purity
of the purusha and buddhi or sattva.</p>

<p class='c007'>(8) Personal consciousness arises when the purusha,
though in its nature unchangeable, is cast into the mould of
the psychosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>(9) Since the mind-objects exist only for the purusha, experience
consists in the non-differentiation of these two which
in their natures are absolutely distinct; the knowledge of
self arises out of concentration on its nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus in <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite>, II. 6, dṛik or purusha the seer is spoken
of as śakti or power as much as the prakṛti itself, and we
see that their identity is only apparent. Vyāsa in his <cite>Bhāshya</cite>
explains <i>ekātmatā</i> (unity of nature or identity) as <i>avibhāgaprāptāviva</i>,
“as if there is no difference.” And Pañcaśikha,
as quoted in <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, writes: “not knowing the
purusha beyond the mind to be different therefrom, in nature,
character and knowledge, etc., a man has the notion of self,
in the mind through delusion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we see that when the mind and purusha are known to
be separated, the real nature of purusha is realised. This
seeming identity is again described as that which perceives
the particular form of the mind and thereby appears, as
identical with it though it is not so (<i>pratyayānupaśya—pratyayāni
bauddhamanupaśyati tamanupaśyannatadātmāpi
tadātmaka iva pratibhāti</i>, <cite>Vāysa-bhāshya</cite>, II. 20).</p>

<p class='c007'>The purusha thus we see, cognises the phenomena of consciousness
after they have been formed, and though its nature
is different from conscious states yet it appears to be the same.
Vyāsa in explaining this sūtra says that purusha is neither
quite similar to the mind nor altogether different from it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>For the mind (<i>buddhi</i>) is always changeful, according to the
change of the objects that are offered to it; so that it may be
said to be changeful according as it knows or does not know
objects; but the purusha is not such, for it always appears
as the self, being reflected through the mind by which it is
thus connected with the phenomenal form of knowledge. The
notion of self that appears connected with all our mental
phenomena and which always illumines them is only duo to
this reflection of purusha in the mind. All phenomenal
knowledge which has the form of the object can only be
transformed into conscious knowledge as “I know this,”
when it becomes connected with the self or purusha. So the
purusha may in a way be said to see again what was perceived
by the mind and thus to impart consciousness by transferring
its illumination into the mind. The mind suffers changes
according to the form of the object of cognition, and thus
results a state of conscious cognition in the shape of “I know
it,” when the mind, having assumed the shape of an object,
becomes connected with the constant factor purusha, through
the transcendent reflection or identification of purusha in the
mind. This is what is meant by <i>pratyayānupaśya</i> reperception
of the mind-transformations by purusha, whereby the
mind which has assumed the shape of any object of consciousness
becomes intelligent. Even when the mind is without
any objective form, it is always being seen by purusha.
The exact nature of this reflection is indeed very hard to comprehend;
no physical illustrations can really serve to make it
clear. And we see that neither the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> nor the
sūtras offer any such illustrations as Sāṃkhya did. But the
<cite>Bhāshya</cite> proceeds to show the points in which the mind may
be said to differ from purusha, as well as those in which it
agrees with it. So that though we cannot express it anyhow,
we may at least make some advance towards conceiving the
situation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Thus the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> says that the main difference between
the mind and purusha is that the mind is constantly undergoing
modifications, as it grasps its objects one by one; for
the grasping of an object, the act of having a percept is
nothing but its own undergoing of different modifications,
and thus, since an object sometimes comes within the grasp
of the mind and again disappears in the subconscious as a
saṃskāra (potency) and again comes into the field of the
understanding as smṛti (memory), we see that it is pariṇāmi
or changing. But purusha is the constant seer of the mind
when it has an object, as in ordinary forms of phenomenal
knowledge, or when it has no object as in the state of nirodha
or cessation. Purusha is unchanging. It is the light which
remains unchanged amidst all the changing modifications of
the mind, so that we cannot distinguish purusha separately
from the mind. This is what is meant by saying <i>buddheḥ
pratisaṃvedī purushaḥ</i>, i.e. purusha reflects or turns into its
own light the concepts of mind and thus is said to know it.
Its knowing is manifested in our consciousness as the ever-persistent
notion of the self, which is always a constant
factor in all the phenomena of consciousness. Thus purusha
always appears in our consciousness as the knowing agent.
Truly speaking, however, purusha only sees himself; he is
not in any way in touch with the mind. He is absolutely free
from all bondage, absolutely unconnected with prakṛti.
From the side of appearance he seems only to be the intelligent
seer imparting consciousness to our conscious-like conception,
though in reality he remains the seer of himself all
the while. The difference between purusha and prakṛti will
be clear when we see that purusha is altogether independent,
existing in and for himself, free from any bondage whatsoever;
but buddhi exists on the other hand for the enjoyment
and release of purusha. That which exists in and for itself,
must ever be the selfsame, unchangeable entity, suffering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>no transformations or modifications, for it has no other end
owing to which it will be liable to change. It is the self-centred,
self-satisfied light, which never seeks any other end
and never leaves itself. But prakṛti is not such; it is always
undergoing endless, complex modifications and as such does
not exist for itself but for purusha, and is dependent upon
him. The mind is unconscious, while purusha is the pure
light of intelligence, for the three guṇas are all non-intelligent,
and the mind is nothing but a modification of these three
guṇas which are all non-intelligent.</p>

<p class='c007'>But looked at from another point of view, prakṛti is not
altogether different from purusha; for had it been so how
could purusha, which is absolutely pure, reperceive the mind-modifications?
Thus the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> (II. 20) writes:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well then let him be dissimilar. To meet this he says:
He is not quite dissimilar. Why? Although pure, he sees
the ideas after they have come into the mind. Inasmuch as
purusha cognises the ideas in the form of mind-modification,
he appears to be, by the act of cognition, the very self of the
mind although in reality he is not.” As has been said, the
power of the enjoyer, purusha (<i>dṛkśakti</i>), is certainly unchangeable
and it does not run after every object. In connection
with a changeful object it appears forever as if it
were being transferred to every object and as if it were
assimilating its modifications. And when the modifications
of the mind assume the form of the consciousness by which
it is coloured, they imitate it and look as if they were manifestations
of purusha’s consciousness unqualified by the
modifications of the non-intelligent mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>All our states of consciousness are analysed into two parts—a
permanent and a changing part. The changing part is
the form of our consciousness, which is constantly varying
according to the constant change of its contents. The permanent
part is that pure light of intelligence, by virtue of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>we have the notion of self reflected in our consciousness.
Now, as this self persists through all the varying changes of
the objects of consciousness, it is inferred that the light
which thus shines in our consciousness is unchangeable.
Our mind is constantly suffering a thousand modifications,
but the notion of self is the only thing permanent amidst all
this change. It is this self that imports consciousness to the
material parts of our knowledge. All our concepts originated
from our perception of external material objects. Therefore
the forms of our concepts which could exactly and clearly
represent these material objects in their own terms, must
be made of a stuff which in essence is not different from them.
But with the reflection of purusha, the soul, the notion of
self comes within the content of our consciousness, spiritualising,
as it were, all our concepts and making them conscious
and intelligent. Thus this seeming identity of purusha and
the mind, by which purusha may be spoken of as the seer of
the concept, appears to the self, which is manifested in consciousness
by virtue of the seeming reflection. For this is
that self, or personality, which remains unchanged all through
our consciousness. Thus our phenomenal intelligent self
is partially a material reality arising out of the seeming
interaction of the spirit and the mind. This interaction is
the only way by which matter releases spirit from its seeming
bondage.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the question arises, how is it that there can even be
a seeming reflection of purusha in the mind which is altogether
non-intelligent? How is it possible for the mind to catch a
glimpse of purusha, which illuminates all the concepts of
consciousness, the expression “<i>anupaśya</i>” meaning that he
perceives by imitation (<i>anukāreṇa paśyati</i>)? How can
purusha, which is altogether formless, allow any reflection
of itself to imitate the form of buddhi, by virtue of which it
appears as the self—the supreme possessor and knower of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>all our mental conceptions? There must be at least some
resemblance between the mind and the purusha, to justify
in some sense this seeming reflection. And we find that the
last sūtra of the Vibhūtipāda says: <i>sattvapurushayoḥ śuddhisāmye
kaivalyaṃ</i>—which means that when the sattva or
the preponderating mind-stuff becomes as pure as purusha,
kaivalya or oneness is attained. This shows that the pure
nature of sattva has a great resemblance to the pure nature
of purusha. So much so, that the last stage preceding the state
of kaivalya, is almost the same as kaivalya itself, when purusha
is in himself and there are no thoughts to reflect. In this
state, we see that the mind can be so pure as to reflect exactly
the nature of purusha, as he is in himself. This state in which
the mind becomes as pure as purusha and reflects him in his
purity, does not materially differ from the state of kaivalya,
in which purusha is in himself—the only difference being that
the mind, when it becomes so pure as this, becomes gradually
lost in prakṛti and cannot again serve to bind purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>I cannot refrain here from the temptation of referring to
a beautiful illustration from Vyāsa, to explain the way in
which the mind serves the purposes of purusha. <i>Cittamayaskāntamaṇikalpaṃ
sannidhimātropakāri dṛśyatvena svaṃ bhavati
purushasya svāminaḥ</i> (I. 4), which is explained in
<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> as follows: <i>Tathāyaskāntamaṇiḥ svasminneva
ayaḥsannidhīkaraṇamātrāt śalyarishkarshaṇākhyam upakāram
kurvat purushasya svāminaḥ svam bhvati bhogasādhanatvāt</i>, i.e.
just as a magnet draws iron towards it, though it remains unmoved
itself, so the mind-modifications become drawn
towards purusha, and thereby become visible to purusha and
serve his purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>To summarise: We have seen that something like a union
takes place between the mind and purusha, i.e. there is a
seeming reflection of purusha in the mind, simultaneously
with its being determined conceptually, as a result whereof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>this reflection of purusha in the mind, which is known as the
self, becomes united with these conceptual determinations
of the mind and the former is said to be the perceiver of all
these determinations. Our conscious personality or self
is thus the seeming unity of the knowable as the mind in the
shape of conceptual or judgmental representations with the
reflections of purusha in the mind. Thus, in the single act
of cognition, we have the notion of our own personality and
the particular conceptual or perceptual representation with
which this ego identifies itself. The true seer, the pure
intelligence, the free, the eternal, remains all the while beyond
any touch of impurity from the mind, though it must be
remembered that it is its own seeming reflection in the mind
that appears as the ego, the cogniser of all our states, pleasures
and sorrows of the mind and one who is the apperceiver of
this unity of the seeming reflection—of purusha and the
determinations of the mind. In all our conscious states, there
is such a synthetic unity between the determinations of our
mind and the self, that they cannot be distinguished one from
the other—a fact which is exemplified in all our cognitions,
which are the union of the knower and the known. The
nature of this reflection is a transcendent one and can never
be explained by any physical illustration. Purusha is altogether
different from the mind, inasmuch as he is the pure
intelligence and is absolutely free, while the latter is non-intelligent
and dependent on purusha’s enjoyment and
release, which are the sole causes of its movement. But there
is some similarity between the two, for how could the mind
otherwise catch a seeming glimpse of him? It is also said
that the pure mind can adapt itself to the pure form of
purusha; this is followed by the state of kaivalya.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have discussed the nature of purusha and its general
relations with the mind. We must now give a few more
illustrations. The chief point in which purusha of the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>differs from the similar spiritual principle of
Vedānta is, that it regards its soul, not as one, but as many.
Let us try to discuss this point, in connection with the arguments
of the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala doctrine in favour of a
separate principle of purusha. Thus the <cite>Kārikā</cite> says:
<i>saṃghātaparārthatvāt triguṇādiviparyyayādadhishthānāt purusho’sti
bhoktṛbhāvāt kaivalyārthaṃ pravṛtteśca</i>,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> “Because an
assemblage of things is for the sake of another; because there
must be an entity different from the three guṇas and the rest
(their modifications); because there must be a superintending
power; because there must be someone who enjoys; and
because of (the existence of) active exertion for the sake of
abstraction or isolation (from the contact with prakṛti)
therefore the soul exists.” The first argument is from design
or teleology by which it is inferred that there must be some
other simple entity for which these complex collocations of
things are intended. Thus Gauḍapāda says: “In such
manner as a bed, which is an assemblage of bedding, props,
cotton, coverlet and pillows, is for another’s use, not for its
own, and its several component parts render no mutual
service, and it is concluded that there is a man who sleeps
upon the bed and for whose sake it was made; so this world,
which is an assemblage of the five elements, is for
use and there is a soul, for whose enjoyment this body,
another’s consisting of intellect and the rest, has been
produced.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>second argument</i> is that all the knowable is composed
of just three elements: first, the element of sattva, or intelligence-stuff,
causing all manifestations; second, the
element of rajas or energy, which is ever causing transformations;
and third, tamas, or the mass, which enables rajas
to actualise. Now such a prakṛti, composed of these three
elements, cannot itself be a seer. For the seer must be always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the same unchangeable, actionless entity, the ever present,
ever constant factor in all stages of our consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Third argument</i>: There must be a supreme background
of pure consciousness, all our co-ordinated basis of experience.
This background is the pure actionless purusha, reflected
in which all our mental states become conscious. Davies
explains this a little differently, in accordance with a simile
in the <cite>Tattva-Kaumudī</cite>, <i>yathā rathādi yantrādibhiḥ</i>, thus:
“This idea of Kapila seems to be that the power of self-control
cannot be predicted of matter, which must be directed
or controlled for the accomplishment of any purpose, and
this controlling power must be something external to matter
and diverse from it. The soul, however, never acts. It only
seems to act; and it is difficult to reconcile this part of the
system with that which gives to the soul a controlling force.
If the soul is a charioteer, it must be an active force.” But
Davies here commits the mistake of carrying the simile too
far. The comparison of the charioteer and the chariot holds
good, to the extent that the chariot can take a particular
course only when there is a particular purpose for the charioteer
to perform. The motion of the chariot is fulfilled only
when it is connected with the living person of the charioteer,
whose purpose it must fulfil.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fourth argument</i>: Since prakṛti is non-intelligent, there
must be one who enjoys its pains and pleasures. The emotional
and conceptual determinations of such feelings are
aroused in consciousness by the seeming reflection of the light
of purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fifth argument</i>: There is a tendency in all persons to move
towards the oneness of purusha, to be achieved by liberation;
there must be one for whose sake the modifications of buddhi
are gradually withheld, and a reverse process set up, by which
they return to their original cause prakṛti and thus liberate
purusha. It is on account of this reverse tendency of prakṛti
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to release purusha that a man feels prompted to achieve his
liberation as the highest consummation of his moral ideal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus having proved the existence of purusha, the <cite>Kārikā</cite>
proceeds to prove his plurality: “<i>janmamaraṇakaraṇānāṃ
pratiniyamādayugapat pravṛtteśca purushabahutvaṃ siddhaṃ
traiguṇyaviparyyayācca</i>.” “From the individual allotment
of birth, death and the organs; from diversity of occupations
and from the different conditions of the three guṇas, it is
proved that there is a plurality of souls.” In other words,
since with the birth of one individual, all are not born; since
with the death of one, all do not die; and since each individual
has separate sense organs for himself; and since all beings
do not work at the same time in the same manner; and since
the qualities of the different guṇas are possessed differently
by different individuals, purushas are many. Patañjali,
though he does not infer the plurality of purushas in this way,
yet holds the view of the sūtra, <i>kṛtārthaṃ prati nashṭamapyanashṭaṃ
tadanyasādhāraṇatvāt</i>. “Although destroyed in
relation to him whose objects have been achieved, it is not
destroyed, being common to others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Davies, in explaining the former <cite>Kārikā</cite>, says: “There is,
however, the difficulty that the soul is not affected by the
three guṇas. How can their various modifications prove the
individuality of souls in opposition to the Vedāntist doctrine,
that all souls are only portions of the one, an infinitely extended
monad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This question is the most puzzling in the Sāṃkhya doctrine.
But careful penetration of the principles of Sāṃkhya-Yoga
would make clear to us that this is a necessary and consistent
outcome of the Sāṃkhya view of a dualistic universe.</p>

<p class='c007'>For if it is said that purusha is one and we have the notion
of different selves by his reflection into different minds, it
follows that such notions as self, or personality, are false.
For the only true being is the one, purusha. So the knower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>being false, the known also becomes false; the knower and
the known having vanished, everything is reduced to that
which we can in no way conceive. It may be argued that
according to the Sāṃkhya philosophy also, the knower is
false, for the pure purusha as such is not in any way connected
with prakṛti. But even then it must be observed that the
Sāṃkhya-Yoga view does not hold that the knower is false
but analyses the nature of the ego and says that it is due to
the seeming unity of the mind and purusha, both of which
are reals in the strictest sense of the term. Purusha is there
justly called the knower. He sees and simultaneously with
this, there is a modification of buddhi (mind); this seeing
becomes joined with this modification of buddhi and thus
arises the ego, who perceives that particular form of the
modification of buddhi. Purusha always remains the knower.
Buddhi suffers modifications and at the same time catches
a glimpse of the light of purusha, so that contact (<i>saṃyoga</i>) of
purusha and prakṛti occurs at one and the same point
of time, in which there is unity of the reflection of purusha
and the particular transformation of buddhi.</p>

<p class='c007'>The knower, the ego and the knowable, are none of them
false in the Sāṃkhya-Yoga system at the stage preceding
kaivalya, when buddhi becomes as pure as purusha; its
modification resembles the exact form of purusha and then
purusha knows himself in his true nature in buddhi; after
which buddhi vanishes. The Vedānta has to admit the
modifications of māyā, but must at the same time hold it
to be unreal. The Vedānta says that māyā is as beginningless
as prakṛti yet has an ending with reference to the released
person as the buddhi of the Sāṃkhyists.</p>

<p class='c007'>But according to the Vedānta philosophy, knowledge of
ego is only false knowledge—an illusion as many imposed
upon the formless Brahman. Māyā, according to the
Vedāntist, can neither be said to exist nor to non-exist. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>is <i>anirvācyā</i>, i.e. can never be described or defined. Such an
unknown and unknowable māyā causes the Many of the
world by reflection upon the Brahman. But according to the
Sāṃkhya doctrine, prakṛti is as real as purusha himself.
Prakṛti and purusha are two irreducible metaphysical remainders
whose connection is beginningless (<i>anādisaṃyoga</i>).
But this connection is not unreal in the Vedānta sense of the
term. We see that according to the Vedānta system, all
notions of ego or personality are false and are originated by the
illusive action of the māyā, so that when they ultimately
vanish there are no other remainders. But this is not the
case with Sāṃkhya, for as purusha is the real seer, his cognitions
cannot be dismissed as unreal, and so purushas or
knowers as they appear to us to be, must be held real. As
prakṛti is not the māyā of the Vedāntist (the nature of whose
influence over the spiritual principle cannot be determined)
we cannot account for the plurality of purushas by supposing
that one purusha is being reflected into many minds and
generating the many egos. For in that case it will be difficult
to explain the plurality of their appearances in the minds
(buddhis). For if there be one spiritual principle, how should
we account for the supposed plurality of the buddhis? For
we should rather expect to find one buddhi and not many
to serve the supposed one purusha, and this will only mean
that there can be only one ego, his enjoyment and release.
Supposing for argument’s sake that there are many buddhis
and one purusha, which reflected in them, is the cause of the
plurality of selves, then we cannot see how prakṛti is moving
for the enjoyment and release of one purusha; it would
rather appear to be moved for the sake of the enjoyment
and release of the reflected or unreal self. For purusha is
not finally released with the release of any number of particular
individual selves. For it may be released with reference
to one individual but remain bound to others. So prakṛti
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>would not really be moved in this hypothetical case for the
sake of purusha, but for the sake of the reflected selves only.
If we wish to avoid the said difficulties, then with the release
of one purusha, all purushas will have to be released. For
in the supposed theory there would not really be many
different purushas, but the one purusha appearing as many,
so that with his release all the other so-called purushas must
be released. We see that if it is the enjoyment (<i>bhoga</i>) and
salvation (<i>apavarga</i>) of one purusha which appear as so many
different series of enjoyments and emancipations, then with
his experiences all should have the same experiences. With
his birth and death, all should be born or all should die at
once. For, indeed, it is the experiences of one purusha which
appear in all the seeming different purushas. And in the
other suppositions there is neither emancipation nor enjoyment
by purusha at all. For there, it is only the illusory self
that enjoys or releases himself. By his release no purusha
is really released at all. So the fundamental conception of
prakṛti as moving for the sake of the enjoyment and release
of purusha has to be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>So we see that from the position in which Sāṃkhya and
Yoga stood, this plurality of the purushas was the most
consistent thing that they could think of. Any compromise
with the Vedānta doctrine here would have greatly changed
the philosophical aspect and value of the Sāṃkhya philosophy.
As the purushas are nothing but pure intelligences they can
as well be all-pervading though many. But there is another
objection that, since number is a conception of the phenomenal
mind, how then can it be applied to the purushas which are
said to be many?<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> But that difficulty remains unaltered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>even if we regard the purusha as one. When we go into the
domain of metaphysics and try to represent Reality with the
symbols of our phenomenal conceptions we have really to
commit almost a violence towards it. But we must perforce
do this in all our attempts to express in our own terms that
pure, inexpressible, free illumination which exists in and for
itself beyond the range of any mediation by the concepts
or images of our mind. So we see that Sāṃkhya was not
inconsistent in holding the doctrine of the plurality of the
purushas. Patañjali does not say anything about it, since
he is more anxious to discuss other things connected with
the presupposition of the plurality of purusha. Thus he
speaks of it only in one place as quoted above and says that
though for a released person this world disappears altogether,
still it remains unchanged in respect to all the other purushas.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='c013'>THE REALITY OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We may now come to the attempt of Yoga to prove the
reality of an external world as against the idealistic Buddhists.
In sūtra 12 of the chapter on kaivalya we find: “The past
and the future exist in reality, since all qualities of things
manifest themselves in these three different ways. The
future is the manifestation which is to be. The past is the
appearance which has been experienced. The present is
that which is in active operation. It is this threefold substance
which is the object of knowledge. If it did not exist
in reality, there would not exist a knowledge thereof. How
could there be knowledge in the absence of anything knowable?
For this reason the past and present in reality exist.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So we see that the present holding within itself the past
and the future exists in reality. For the past though it has
been negated has really been preserved and kept in the
present, and the future also though it has not made its appearance
yet exists potentially in the present. So, as we know
the past and the future worlds in the present, they both exist
and subsist in the present. That which once existed cannot
die, and that which never existed cannot come to be (<i>nāstyasataḥ
saṃbhavaḥ na cāsti sato vināsāḥ</i>, <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, V. 12).
So the past has not been destroyed but has rather shifted its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>position and hidden itself in the body of the present, and the
future that has not made its appearance exists in the present
only in a potential form. It cannot be argued, as Vācaspati
says, that because the past and the future are not present
therefore they do not exist, for if the past and future do not
exist how can there be a present also, since its existence
also is only relative? So all the three exist as truly as any
one of them, and the only difference among them is the
different way or mode of their existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>He next proceeds to refute the arguments of those idealists
who hold that since the external knowables never exist
independently of our knowledge of them, their separate
external existence as such may be denied. Since it is by
knowledge alone that the external knowables can present
themselves to us we may infer that there is really no knowable
external reality apart from knowledge of it, just as we see
that in dream-states knowledge can exist apart from the
reality of any external world.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it may be argued that there is, indeed, no external
reality as it appears to us. The Buddhists, for example, hold
that a blue thing and knowledge of it as blue are identical
owing to the maxim that things which are invariably perceived
together are one (<i>sahopalambhaniyamādabhedo nīlataddhiyoḥ</i>).
So they say that external reality is not different
from our idea of it. To this it may be replied that if, as you
say, external reality is identical with my ideas and there is
no other external reality existing as such outside my ideas,
why then does it appear as existing apart, outside and independent
of my ideas? The idealists have no basis for the
denial of external reality, and for their assertion that it is
only the creation of our imagination like experiences in dreams.
Even our ideas carry with them the notion that reality exists
outside our mental experiences. If all our percepts and
notions as this and that arise only by virtue of the influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of the external world, how can they deny the existence of the
external world as such? The objective world is present by
its own power. How then can this objective world be given
up on the strength of mere logical or speculative abstraction?</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, IV. 14, says: “There is no
object without the knowledge of it, but there is knowledge
as imagined in dreams without any corresponding object;
thus the reality of external things is like that of dream-objects,
mere imagination of the subject and unreal. How
can they who say so be believed? Since they first suppose
that the things which present themselves to us by their own
force do so only on account of the invalid and delusive imagination
of the intellect, and then deny the reality of the external
world on the strength of such an imaginary supposition of
their own.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The external world has generated knowledge of itself
by its own presentative power (<i>arthena svakīyayāgrāhyaśaktyā
vijñānamajani</i>), and has thus caused itself to be represented
in our ideas, and we have no right to deny it.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Commenting
on the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> IV. 14, Vācaspati says that the method
of agreement applied by the Buddhists by their <i>sahopalambhaniyama</i>
(maxim of simultaneous revelation) may possibly
be confuted by an application of the method of difference.
The method of agreement applied by the idealists when put
in proper form reads thus: “Wherever there is knowledge
there is external reality, or rather every case of knowledge
agrees with or is the same as every case of the presence of
external reality, so knowledge is the cause of the presence of
the external reality, i.e. the external world depends for its
reality on our knowledge or ideas and owes its origin or
appearance as such to them.” But Vācaspati says that this
application of the method of agreement is not certain, for it
cannot be corroborated by the method of difference. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>the statement that every case of absence of knowledge is also
a case of absence of external reality cannot be proved, i.e.
we cannot prove that the external reality does not exist
when we have no knowledge of it (<i>sahopalambhaniyamaśca
vedyatvañca hetū sandigdhavyatirekatayānaikāntikau</i>) IV. 14.</p>

<p class='c007'>Describing the nature of grossness and externality, the
attributes of the external world, he says that grossness means
the pervading of more portions of space than one, i.e. grossness
means extension, and externality means being related to
separate space, i.e. co-existence in space. Thus we see that
extension and co-existence in space are the two fundamental
qualities of the gross external world. Now an idea can never
be said to possess them, for it cannot be said that an idea has
extended into more spaces than one and yet co-existed
separately in separate places. An idea cannot be said to
exist with other ideas in space and to extend in many points
of space at one and the same time. To avoid this it cannot
be said that there may be plurality of ideas so that some may
co-exist and others may extend in space. For co-existence
and extension can never be asserted of our ideas, since +hey
are very fine and subtle, and can be known only at the time of
their individual operation, at which time, however, other ideas
may be quite latent and unknown. Imagination has no power
to negate their reality, for the sphere of imagination is quite
distinct from the sphere of external reality, and it can never
be applied to an external reality to negate it. Imagination is
a mental function, and as such has no touch with the reality
outside, which it can by no means negate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further it cannot be said that, because grossness and
externality can abide neither in the external world nor in
our ideas, they are therefore false. For this falsity cannot be
thought as separable from our ideas, for in that case our ideas
would be as false as the false itself. The notion of externality
and grossness pervades all our ideas, and if they are held to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>be false, no true thing can be known by our ideas and they
therefore become equally false.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, knowledge and the external world can never be said
to be identical because they happen to be presented together.
For the method of agreement cannot by itself prove identity.
Knowledge and the knowable external world may be independently
co-existing things like the notions of existence and
non-existence. Both co-exist independently of one another.
It is therefore clear enough, says Vācaspati, that the certainty
arrived at by perception, which gives us a direct knowledge
of things, can never be rejected on the strength of mere
logical abstraction or hair-splitting discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>We further see, says Patañjali, that the thing remains
the same though the ideas and feelings of different men may
change differently about it.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Thus A, B, C may perceive
the same identical woman and may feel pleasure, pain or
hatred. We see that the same common thing generates
different feelings and ideas in different persons; external
reality cannot be said to owe its origin to the idea or imagination
of any one man, but exists independently of any person’s
imagination in and for itself. For if it be due to the imagination
of any particular man, it is his own idea which as such
cannot generate the same ideas in another man. So it must be
said that the external reality is what we perceive it outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are, again, others who say that just as pleasure
and pain arise along with our ideas and must be said to be due
to them so the objective world also must be said to have come
into existence along with our ideas. The objective world
therefore according to these philosophers has no external
existence either in the past or in the future, but has only
a momentary existence in the present due to our ideas about
it. That much existence only are they ready to attribute
to external objects which can be measured by the idea of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>moment. The moment I have an idea of a thing, the thing
rises into existence and may be said to exist only for that
moment and as soon as the idea disappears the object also
vanishes, for when it cannot be presented to me in the form
of ideas it can be said to exist in no sense. But this argument
cannot hold good, for if the objective reality should really
depend upon the idea of any individual man, then the objective
reality corresponding to an idea of his ought to cease to exist
either with the change of his idea, or when he directs attention
to some other thing, or when he restrains his mind from all
objects of thought. Now, then, if it thus ceases to exist, how
can it again spring into existence when the attention of the
individual is again directed towards it? Again, all parts of
an object can never be seen all at once. Thus supposing that
the front side of a thing is visible, then the back side which
cannot be seen at the time must not be said to exist at all.
So if the back side does not exist, the front side also can as
well be said not to exist (<i>ye cāsyānupasthitā bhāgaste cāsya
na syurevaṃ nāsti pṛshṭhamiti udaramapi na gṛhyeta.</i> <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>,
IV. 16). Therefore it must be said that there is an
independent external reality which is the common field of
observation for all souls in general; and there are also
separate “Cittas” for separate individual souls (<i>tasmāt
svatantro’rthaḥ sarvapurusasādhdāraṇaḥ svatantrāṇi ca cittāni
pratipurushaṃ, pravarttante</i>, <i>ibid.</i>). And all the experiences
of the purusha result from the connection of this “Citta”
(mind) with the external world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now from this view of the reality of the external world we
are confronted with another question—what is the ground
which underlies the manifold appearance of this external
world which has been proved to be real? What is that something
which is thought as the vehicle of such qualities as produce
in us the ideas? What is that self-subsistent substratum
which is the basis of so many changes, actions and reactions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that we always meet in the external world? Locke called
this substratum substance and regarded it as unknown, but
said that though it did not follow that it was a product of
our own subjective thought yet it did not at the same time
exist without us. Hume, however, tried to explain everything
from the standpoint of association of ideas and denied all
notions of substantiality. We know that Kant, who was much
influenced by Hume, agreed to the existence of some such
unknown reality which he called the Thing-in-itself, the nature
of which, however, was absolutely unknowable, but whose
influence was a great factor in all our experiences.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> tries to penetrate deeper into the nature
of this substratum or substance and says: <i>dharmisvarūpamātro
hi dharmaḥ, dharmivikriyā eva eshā dharmadvārā prapañcyate</i>,
<cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, III. 13. The characteristic qualities form the
very being itself of the characterised, and it is the change of
the characterised alone that is detailed by means of the
characteristic. To understand thoroughly the exact significance
of this statement it will be necessary to take a more
detailed review of what has already been said about the guṇas.
We know that all things mental or physical are formed by the
different collocations of sattva of the nature of illumination
(<i>prakāśa</i>), rajas—the energy or mutative principle of the
nature of action (<i>kriyā</i>)—and tamas—the obstructive principle
of the nature of inertia (<i>sthiti</i>) which in their original and
primordial state are too fine to be apprehended (<i>gunānāṃparamaṃ
rūpaṃ na dṛshṭipathamṛcchati</i>, <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, IV. 13).
These different guṇas combine in various proportions to form
the manifold universe of the knowable, and thus are made the
objects of our cognition. Through combining in different
proportions they become, in the words of Dr. B. N. Seal, “more
and more differentiated, determinate and coherent,” and thus
make themselves cognisable, yet they never forsake their own
true nature as the guṇas. So we see that they have thus got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>two natures, one in which they remain quite unchanged as
guṇas, and another in which they collocate and combine
themselves in various ways and thus appear under the veil
of a multitude of qualities and states of the manifold knowable
(<i>te vyaktasūkshmā guṇātmānaḥ</i> [IV. 13]&#160;... <i>sarvamidaṃ
guṇānāṃ sanniveśaviśeshamātramiti paramārthato guṇātmānaḥ</i>,
<cite>Bhāshya</cite>, <i>ibid.</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Now these guṇas take three different courses of development
from the ego or ahaṃkāra according to which the ego or
ahaṃkāra may be said to be sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa.
Thus from the sāttvika side of the ego by a preponderance of
sattva the five knowledge-giving senses, e.g. hearing, sight,
touch, taste and smell are derived. From the rajas side of
ego by a preponderance of rajas the five active senses of speech,
etc., are derived. From the tamas side of ego or ahaṃkāra
by a preponderance of tamas are derived the five tanmātras.
From which again by a preponderance of tamas the atoms of
the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether are
derived.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the derivation of these it must be remembered that
all the three guṇas are conjointly responsible. In the derivation
of a particular product one of the guṇas may indeed be
predominant, and thus may bestow the prominent characteristic
of that product, but the other two guṇas are also present
there and perform their functions equally well. Their
opposition does not withhold the progress of evolution but
rather helps it. All the three combine together in varying
degrees of mutual preponderance and thus together help the
process of evolution to produce a single product. Thus we
see that though the guṇas are three, they combine to produce
on the side of perception, the senses, such as those of hearing,
sight, etc.; and on the side of the knowable, the individual
tanmātras of gandha, rasa, rūpa, sparśa and śabda. The
guṇas composing each tanmātra again harmoniously combine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>with each other with a preponderance of tamas to produce
the atoms of each gross element. Thus in each combination
one class of guṇas remains prominent, while the others
remain dependent upon it but help it indirectly in the evolution
of that particular product.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='c013'>THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The evolution which we have spoken of above may be
characterised in two ways: (1) That arising from modifications
or products of some other cause which are themselves
capable of originating other products like themselves; (2)
That arising from causes which, though themselves derived,
yet cannot themselves be the cause of the origination of other
existences like themselves. The former may be said to be
slightly specialised (<i>aviśesha</i>) and the latter thoroughly
specialised (<i>viśesha</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we see that from prakṛti comes mahat, from mahat
comes ahaṃkāra, and from ahaṃkāra, as we have seen above,
the evolution takes three different courses according to the
preponderance of sattva, rajas and tamas originating the
cognitive and conative senses and manas, the superintendent
of them both on one side and the tanmātras on the other.
These tanmātras again produce the five gross elements.
Now when ahaṃkāra produces the tanmātras or the senses,
or when the tanmātras produce the five gross elements, or
when ahaṃkāra itself is produced from buddhi or mahat,
it is called <i>tattvāntara-pariṇāma</i>, i.e. the production of a
different tattva or substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus in the case of <i>tattvāntara-pariṇāma</i> (as for example
when the tanmātras are produced from ahaṃkāra), it must
be carefully noticed that the state of being involved in the
tanmātras is altogether different from the state of being of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>ahaṃkāra; it is not a mere change of quality but a change
of existence or state of being.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Thus though the tanmātras
are derived from ahaṃkāra the traces of ahaṃkāra cannot
be easily followed in them. This derivation is not such that
the ahaṃkāra remains principally unchanged and there is
only a change of quality in it, but it is a different existence
altogether, having properties which differ widely from those
of ahaṃkāra. So it is called tattvāntara-pariṇāma, i.e.
evolution of different categories of existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the evolution that the senses and the five gross elements
can undergo can never be of this nature, for they are viśeshas,
or substances which have been too much specialised to allow
the evolution of any other substance of a different grade of
existence from themselves. With them there is an end of all
emanation. So we see that the aviśeshas or slightly specialised
emanations are those which being themselves but emanations
can yet yield other emanations from themselves. Thus we
see that mahat, ahaṃkāra and the five tanmātras are themselves
emanations, as well as the source of other emanations.
Mahat, however, though it is undoubtedly an aviśesha or
slightly specialised emanation, is called by another technical
name liṅga or sign, for from the state of mahat, the prakṛti
from which it must have emanated may be inferred. Prakṛti,
however, from which no other primal state is inferable, is called
the aliṅga or that which is not a sign for the existence of any
other primal and more unspecialised state. In one sense all
the emanations can be with justice called the liṅgas or states
of existence standing as the sign by which the causes from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>which they have emanated can be directly inferred. Thus in
this sense the five gross elements maybe called the liṅga of the
tanmātras, and they again of the ego, and that again of the
mahat, for the unspecialised ones are inferred from their
specialised modifications or emanations. But this technical
name liṅga is reserved for the mahat from which the aliṅga
or prakṛti can be inferred. This prakṛti, however, is the
eternal state which is not an emanation itself but the basis
and source of all other emanations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The liṅga and the aliṅga have thus been compared in the
<cite>Kārikā</cite>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>hetumadanityamavyāpi sakriyamanekāśritaṃ liṅgaṃ</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>sāvayavam paratantraṃ vyaktaṃ viparītamavyaktaṃ</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The liṅga has a cause, it is neither eternal nor universal,
but mobile, multiform, dependent, determinate, and possesses
parts, whereas the aliṅga is the reverse. The aliṅga or
prakṛti, however, being the cause has some characteristics in
common with its liṅgas as distinguished from the purushas,
which are altogether different from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the <cite>Kārikā</cite> says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>triguṇamaviveki vishayaḥ sāmānyamacetanaṃ prasavadharmi</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>vyaktaṃ tathā pradhānaṃ tadviparītastathā pumān</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The manifested and the unmanifested <i>pradhāna</i> or <i>prakṛti</i>
are both composed of the three guṇas, non-intelligent, objective,
universal, unconscious and productive. Soul in these
respects is the reverse. We have seen above that prakṛti
is the state of equilibrium of the guṇas, which can in no way
be of any use to the purushas, and is thus held to be eternal,
though all other states are held to be non-eternal as they
are produced for the sake of the purushas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The state of prakṛti is that in which the guṇas completely
overpower each other and the characteristics (<i>dharma</i>)
and the characterised (<i>dharmī</i>) are one and the same.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Evolution is thus nothing but the manifestation of change,
mutation, by the energy of rajas. The rajas is the one
mediating activity that breaks up all compounds, builds up
new ones and initiates original modifications. Whenever in
any particular combination the proportion of sattva, rajas
or tamas alters, as a condition of this alteration, there is the
dominating activity of rajas by which the old equilibrium is
destroyed and another equilibrium established; this in its
turn is again disturbed and again another equilibrium is
restored. Now the manifestation of this latent activity of
rajas is what is called change or evolution. In the external
world the time that is taken by a paramāṇu or atom to move
from its place is identical with a unit of change.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> Now an
atom will be that quantum which is smaller or finer than
that point or limit at which it can in any way be perceived
by the senses. Atoms are therefore mere points without
magnitude or dimension, and the unit of time or moment
(<i>kshaṇa</i>) that is taken up in changing the position of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>atoms is identical with one unit of change or evolution.
The change or evolution in the external world must therefore
be measured by these units of spatial motion of the atoms;
i.e. an atom changing its own unit of space is the measure of
all physical change or evolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each unit of time (<i>kshaṇa</i>) corresponding to this change of
an atom of its own unit of space is the unit-measure of change.
This instantaneous succession of time as discrete moments one
following the other is the notion of the series of moments or
pure and simple succession. Now the notion of these discrete
moments is the notion of time. Even the notion of succession
is one that does not really exist but is imagined, for a moment
comes into being just when the moment just before had passed
so that they have never taken place together. Thus Vyāsa
in III. 52, says: “<i>kshaṇatatkramayornāsti vastusamāhāraḥ iti
buddhisamāhāraḥ muhūrttāhorātrātrādayaḥ</i>.” <i>Sa tvayaṃ kālaḥ
vastuśūnyo’pi buddhinirmāṇaḥ.</i> The moments and their
succession do not belong to the category of actual things;
the hour, the day and night, are all aggregates of mental
conceptions. This time which is not a substantive reality in
itself, but is only a mental concept, represented to us through
linguistic usage, appears to ordinary minds as if it were an
objective reality.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the conception of time as discrete moments is the real
one, whereas the conception of time as successive or as continuous
is unreal, being only due to the imagination of our
empirical and relative consciousness. Thus Vācaspati further
explains it. A moment is real (<i>vastupatitaḥ</i>) and is the essential
element of the notion of succession. Succession involves the
notion of change of moments, and the moment is called time
by those sages who know what time is. Two moments cannot
happen together. There cannot be any succession of two
simultaneous things. Succession means the notion of change
involving a preceding and a succeeding moment. Thus there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>is only the present moment and there are no preceding and
later moments. Therefore there cannot be any union of these
moments. The past and the future moments may be said to
exist only if we speak of past and future as identical with
the changes that have become latent and others that exist
potentially but are not manifested. Thus in one moment,
the whole world suffers changes. All these characteristics
are associated with the thing as connected with one particular
moment.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So we find here that time is essentially discrete, being only
the moments of our cognitive life. As two moments never
co-exist, there is no succession or continuous time. They
exist therefore only in our empirical consciousness which
cannot take the real moments in their discrete nature but
connects the one with the other and thereby imagines either
succession or continuous time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now we have said before, that each unit of change or
evolution is measured by this unit of time <i>kshaṇa</i> or moment;
or rather the units of change are expressed in terms of these
moments or <i>kshaṇas</i>. Of course in our ordinary consciousness
these moments of change cannot be grasped, but they
can be reasonably inferred. For at the end of a certain period
we observe a change in a thing; now this change, though
it becomes appreciable to us after a long while, was still going
on every moment, so, in this way, the succession of evolution
or change cannot be distinguished from the moments coming
one after another. Thus the <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite> says in IV. 33:
“Succession involving a course of changes is associated with
the moments.” Succession as change of moments is grasped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>only by a course of changes. A cloth which has not passed
through a course of changes through a series of moments
cannot be found old all at once at any time. Even a new
cloth kept with good care becomes old after a time. This
is what is called the termination of a course of changes and
by it the succession of a course of changes can be grasped.
Even before a thing is old there can be inferred a sequence
of the subtlest, subtler, subtle, grossest, grosser and gross
changes (<cite>Tattvavaiśāradī</cite>, IV. 33).<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Now as we have seen that the unit of time is indistinguishable
from the unit of change or evolution, and as these moments
are not co-existing but one follows the other, we see that there
is no past or future existing as a continuous before or past,
and after or future. It is the present that really exists as
the manifested moment; the past has been conserved as
sublatent and the future as the latent. So the past and
future exist in the present, the former as one which has already
had its manifestation and is thus conserved in the fact of the
manifestation of the present. For the manifestation of the
present as such could not have taken place until the past
had already been manifested; so the manifestation of the
present is a concrete product involving within itself the manifestation
of the past; in a similar way it may be said that
the manifestation of the present contains within itself the seed
or the unmanifested state of the future, for if this had not
been the case, the future never could have happened. So we
see that the whole world undergoes a change at one unit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>point of time, and not only that but it conserves within itself
all the past and future history of cosmic evolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have pointed out before that the manifestation of the
rajas or energy as action is what is called change. Now this
manifestation of action can only take place when equilibrium
of a particular collocation of guṇas is disturbed and the rajas
arranges or collocates with itself the sattva and tamas, the
whole group being made intelligible by the inherent sattva.
So the cosmic history is only the history of the different
collocations of the guṇas. Now, therefore, if it is possible
for a seer to see in one vision the possible number of combinations
that the rajas will have with sattva and tamas, he can
in one moment perceive the past, present or future of this
cosmic evolutionary process; for with such minds all past
and future are concentrated at one point of vision which to
a person of ordinary empirical consciousness appears only
in the series. For the empirical consciousness, impure as it is,
it is impossible that all the powers and potencies of sattva
and rajas should become manifested at one point of time;
it has to take things only through its senses and can thus
take the changes only as the senses are affected by them;
whereas, on the other hand, if its power of knowing was not
restricted to the limited scope of the senses, it could have
grasped all the possible collocations or changes all at once.
Such a perceiving mind whose power of knowing is not
narrowed by the senses can perceive all the finest modifications
or changes that are going on in the body of a substance
(see <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite>, III. 53).</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='c013'>THE EVOLUTION OF THE CATEGORIES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Yoga analysis points to the fact that all our cognitive
states are distinguished from their objects by the fact of their
being intelligent. This intelligence is the constant factor
which persists amidst all changes of our cognitive states.
We are passing continually from one state to another without
any rest, but in this varying change of these states we are
never divested of intelligence. This fact of intelligence is
therefore neither the particular possession of any one of these
states nor that of the sum of these states; for if it is not the
possession of any one of these states it cannot be the possession
of the sum of these states. In the case of the released person
again there is no mental state, but the self-shining intelligence.
So Yoga regarded this intelligence as quite distinct
from the so-called mental states which became intelligent
by coming in connection with this intelligence. The actionless,
absolutely pure and simple intelligence it called the
purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yoga tacitly assumed a certain kind of analysis of the
nature of these mental states which sought to find out, if
possible, the nature of their constituent elements or moments
of existence. Now in analysing the different states of our
mind we find that a particular content of thought is illuminated
and then passed over. The ideas rise, are illuminated
and pass away. Thus they found that “movement” was
one of the principal elements that constituted the substance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of our thoughts. Thought as such is always moving. This
principle of movement, mutation or change, this energy, they
called rajas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now apart from this rajas, thought when seen as divested
of its sensuous contents seems to exhibit one universal mould
or form of knowledge which assumes the form of all the
sensuous contents that are presented to it. It is the one
universal of all our particular concepts or ideas—the basis
or substratum of all the different shapes imposed upon itself,
the pure and simple. Sattva in which there is no particularity
is that element of our thought which, resembling purusha
most, can attain its reflection within itself and thus makes
the unconscious mental states intelligible. All the contents
of our thought are but modes and limitations of this universal
form and are thus made intelligible. It is the one principle
of intelligibility of all our conscious states.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now our intellectual life consists in a series of shining
ideas or concepts; concepts after concepts shine forth in the
light of the pure intelligence and pass away. But each
concept is but a limitation of the pure shining universal of
our knowledge which underlies all its changing modes or
modifications of concepts or judgments. This is what is called
pure knowledge in which there is neither the knower nor the
known. This pure object—subjectless knowledge differs
from the pure intelligence or purusha only in this that later
on it is liable to suffer various modifications, as the ego,
the senses, and the infinite percepts and concepts, etc., connected
therewith, whereas the pure intelligence remains ever
pure and changeless and is never the substratum of any
change. At this stage sattva, the intelligence-stuff, is
prominent and rajas and tamas are altogether suppressed.
It is for this reason that the buddhi or mind is often spoken
of as the sattva. Being an absolute preponderance of sattva
it has nothing else to manifest, but it is its pure-shining self.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Both tamas and rajas being mostly suppressed they cannot
in any way affect the effulgent nature of this pure shining
of contentless knowledge in which there is neither the knower
nor the known.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it must be remembered that it is holding suspended
as it were within itself the elements of rajas and tamas which
cannot manifest themselves owing to the preponderance of
the sattva.</p>

<p class='c007'>This notion of pure contentless consciousness is immediate
and abstract and as such is at once mediated by other necessary
phases. Thus we see that this pure contentless universal
consciousness is the same as the ego-universal (<i>asmitāmātra</i>).
For this contentless universal consciousness is only another
name for the contentless unlimited, infinite of the ego-universal.
A quotation from Fichte may here be useful as a comparison.
Thus he says in the introduction to his <cite>Science
of Ethics</cite>: “How an object can ever become a subject, or
how a being can ever become an object of representation:
this curious change will never be explained by anyone who
does not find a point where the objective and subjective
are not distinguished at all, but are altogether one. Now
such a point is established by, and made the starting point
of our system. This point is the Egohood, the Intelligence,
Reason, or whatever it may be named.”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a> The <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>,
II. 19, describes it as <i>liṅgamātram mahattatvaṃ sattāmātre
mahati ātmani</i>, and again in I. 36 we find it described as the
waveless ocean, peaceful infinite pure egohood. This obscure
egohood is known merely as being. This mahat has also
been spoken of by Vijñāna Bhikshu as the manas, or mind,
as it has the function of assimilation (<i>niścaya</i>). Now what
we have already said about mahat will, we hope, make it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>clear that this mahat is the last limit at which the subject
and the object can be considered as one indistinguishable
point which is neither the one nor the other, but the source
of both.</p>

<p class='c007'>This buddhi is thus variously called <i>mahat</i>, <i>asmitāmātra</i>,
<i>manas</i>, <i>sattva</i>, <i>buddhi</i> and <i>liṅga</i>, according to the aspects
from which this state is observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>This state is called mahat as it is the most universal thing
conceivable and the one common source from which all other
things originate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now this phase of sattva or pure shining naturally passes
into the other phase, that of the Ego as knower or Ego as
subject. The first phase as mahat or asmitāmātra was the
state in which the sattva was predominant and the rajas and
tamas were in a suppressed condition. The next moment
is that in which the rajas comes uppermost, and thus the
ego as the subject of all cognition—the subject I—the
knower of all the mental states—is derived. The contentless
subject-objectless “I” is the passive sattva aspect
of the buddhi catching the reflection of the spirit of
purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>In its active aspect, however, it feels itself one with the
spirit and appears as the ego or subject which knows, feels
and wills. Thus Patañjali says, in II. 6: <i>dṛgdarśanaśaktyorekātmateva
asmitā</i>, i.e. the seeming identity of the seer
and the perceiving capacity is called asmitā-ego. Again in
<cite>Bhāshya</cite>, I. 17, we have <i>ekātmikā saṃvidasmitā</i> (knowledge as
one identical is asmitā) which Vācaspati explains as <i>sā ca
ātmanā grahītrā saha buddhirekātmikā saṃvid</i>, i.e. it is the
feeling of identity of the buddhi (mind) with the self, the
perceiver. Thus we find that the mind is affected by its own
rajas or activity and posits itself as the ego or subject as
activity. By reason of this position of the “I” as active
it perceives itself in the objective, in all its conative and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>cognitive senses in its thoughts and feelings and also in the
external world of extension and co-existence; in the words
of Pañcaśikha (II. 5) thinking the animate and inanimate
beings to be the self, man regards their prosperity as his own
and becomes glad, and regards their adversity as his own
and is sorry. Here the “I” is posited as the active entity
which becomes conscious of itself, or in other words the
“I” becomes self-conscious. In analysing this notion of
self-consciousness we find that here the rajas or element of
activity or mobility has become predominant and this predominance
of rajas has been manifested by the inherent
sattva. Thus we find that the rajas side or “I as active”
has become manifested or known as such, i.e. “I” becomes
conscious of itself as active. And this is just what is meant
by self-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>This ego or self-consciousness then appears as the modification
of the contentless pure consciousness of the mind (<i>buddhi</i>);
it is for this reason that we see that this self-consciousness is but
a modification of the universal mind. The absolute identity
of subject and object as the egohood is not A part of our
natural consciousness, for in all stages of our actual consciousness,
even in that of self-consciousness, there is an element
of the preponderance of rajas or activity which directs this
unity as the knower and the known and then unites them as
it were. Only so far as I distinguish myself as the conscious,
from myself as the object of consciousness, am I at all conscious
of myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we see that the buddhi transforms itself into the ego,
the subject, or the knower, at this its first phase there is no
other content which it can know, it therefore knows itself
in a very abstract way as the “I,” or in other words, the ego
becomes self-conscious; but at this moment the ego has no
content; the tamas being quite under suppression, it is
evolved by a preponderance of the rajas; and thus its nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>as rajas is manifested by the sattva and thus the ego now
essentially knows itself to be active, and holds itself as the
permanent energising activity which connects with itself all
the phenomena of our life.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now when the ego first directs itself towards itself and
becomes conscious of itself, one question which naturally
comes to our mind is, “Can the ego direct itself towards
itself and thus divide itself into a part that sees and one that
is seen?” To meet this question it is assumed that the
guṇas contain within themselves the germs of both subjectivity
and objectivity (<i>guṇānāṃ hi dvairūpyaṃ vyavasāyātmkatvam
vyavaseyātmakatvaṃ ca. Tattvavaiśāradī</i>, III. 47);
the guṇas have two forms, the perceiver and the perceived.
Thus we find that in the ego the quality of the guṇas as the
perceiver comes to be first manifested and the ego turns
back upon itself and makes itself its own object. It is at this
stage that we are reminded of the twofold nature of the
guṇas.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is by virtue of this twofold nature that the subject can
make itself its own object; but as these two sides have not
yet developed they are still only abstract and exist but in an
implicit way in this state of the ego (<i>ahaṃkāra</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Enquiring further into the nature of the relation of this ego
and the buddhi, we find that the ego is only another phase
or modification of the buddhi; however different it might
appear from buddhi it is only an appearance or phase of it;
its reality is the reality of the buddhi. Thus we see that when
the knower is affected in his different modes of concepts and
judgments, this too is to be ascribed to the buddhi. Thus
Vyāsa writes (II. 18) that perception, memory, differentiation,
reasoning, right knowledge, decision belong properly to mind
(buddhi) and are only illusorily imposed on the purusha
(<i>grahaṇadhāraṇohāpohatattvajñānābhiniveśā buddhau varttamānā
purushe adhyāropitasadbhāvāḥ</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Now from this ego we find that three developments take
place in three distinct directions according to the preponderance
of sattva, rajas or tamas.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the preponderance of rajas, the ego develops itself
into the five conative senses, vāk (speech), pāṇi (hands),
pāda (feet), pāyu (organ of passing the excreta) and upastha
(generative organ). By the preponderance of sattva, the
ego develops itself into the five cognitive senses—hearing,
touch, sight, taste and smell; and by a preponderance of
tamas it stands as the bhūtādi and produces the five tanmātras,
and these again by further preponderance of tamas
develops into the particles of the five gross elements of earth,
water, light, heat, air and ether.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it is clear that when the self becomes conscious of
itself as object we see that there are three phases in it: (i)
that in which the self becomes an object to itself; (ii) when
it directs itself or turns as the subject upon itself as the object,
this moment of activity which can effect an aspect of change
in itself; (iii) the aspect of the consciousness of the self,
the moment in which it perceives itself in its object, the
moment of the union of itself as the subject and itself as the
object in one luminosity of self-consciousness. Now that
phase of self in which it is merely an object to itself is the phase
of its union with prakṛti which further develops the prakṛti in
moments of materiality by a preponderance of the inert
tamas of the bhūtādi into tanmātras and these again into the
five grosser elements which are then called the <i>grāhya</i> or
perceptible.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sattva side of this ego or self-consciousness which was
hitherto undifferentiated becomes further differentiated,
specialised and modified into the five cognitive senses with their
respective functions of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell,
synchronising with the evolution of the prakṛti on the tanmātric
side of evolution. These again individually suffer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>infinite modifications themselves and thus cause an infinite
variety of sensations in their respective spheres in our conscious
life. The rajas side of the ego becomes specialised as the active
faculties of the five different conative organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another specialisation of the ego as the manas
which is its direct instrument for connecting itself with the five
cognitive and conative senses. What is perceived as mere
sensations by the senses is connected and generalised and
formed into concepts by the manas; it is therefore spoken
of as partaking of both the conative and the cognitive aspects
in the <cite>Sāṃkhya-kārikā</cite>, 27.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now though the modifications of the ego are formed
successively by the preponderance of sattva, rajas and tamas,
yet the rajas is always the accessory cause (<i>sahakāri</i>) of all
these varied collocations of the guṇas; it is the supreme
principle of energy and supplies even intelligence with the
energy which it requires for its own conscious activity. Thus
Lokācāryya says in his <cite>Tattvatraya</cite>: “the tāmasa ego
developing into the material world and the sāttvika ego
developing into the eleven senses, both require the help of the
rājasa ego for the production of this development” (<i>anyābhyāṃ
ahaṃkārābhyām svakāryyopajanane rājasāhaṃkūraḥ sahakārī
bhavati</i>); and Barabara in his <cite>Bhāshya</cite> writes: “just as a
seed-sprout requires for its growth the help of water as
instrumental cause, so the rājasa ahaṃkāra (ego) works as the
accessory cause (<i>sahakāri</i>) for the transformations of sāttvika
and tāmasa ahaṃkāra into their evolutionary products.”
The mode of working of this instrumental cause is described as
“rajas is the mover.” The rājasa ego thus moves the sattva
part to generate the senses; the tamas part generating the
gross and subtle matter is also moved by the rajas, agent of
movement. The rājasa ego is thus called the common cause
of the movement of the sāttvika and the tāmasa ego. Vācaspati
also says: “though rajas has no separate work by itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>yet since sattva and tamas (which though capable of undergoing
modification, do not do their work) are actionless in
themselves, the agency of rajas lies in this that it moves them
both for the production of the effect.”<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> And according as the
modifications are sāttvika, tāmasa or rājasika, the ego which
is the cause of these different modifications is also called
vaikārika, bhūtādi and taijasa. The mahat also as the source
of the vaikārika, taijasa and bhūtādi ego may be said to have
three aspects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now speaking of the relation of the sense faculties with
the sense organs, we see that the latter, which are made up of
the grosser elements are the vehicle of the former, for if the
latter are injured in any way, the former are also necessarily
affected.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To take for example the specific case of the faculty of hearing
and its organ, we see that the faculty of hearing is seated in
the ether (<i>ākāśa</i>) within our ear-hole. It is here that the power
of hearing is located. When soundness or defect is noticed
therein, soundness or defect is noticed in the power of hearing
also. When the sounds of solids, etc., are heard, then the
power of hearing located in the hollow of the ear stands in need
of the resonance produced in the ākāśa of the ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>This sense of hearing, then, having its origin in the principle
of ahaṃkāra, behaves like iron, and is drawn by the sounds
originated and located in the mouth of the speaker acting
as loadstone, and transforms them into its own successive
modifications (<i>vṛtti</i>) and thus senses the sounds of the
speaker. And it is for this reason that for every living
creature, the perception of sound in external space
in the absence of defects is never void of authority.
Thus Pancasikha also says, as quoted in <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>,
III. 41:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“To all those whose organs of hearing are situated in the
same place (at different times) the ākāśa sustaining the sense
of hearing is the same.” The ākāśa, again, in which the power
of hearing is seated, is born out of the soniferous tanmātra, and
has therefore the quality of sound inherent in itself. It is by
this sound acting in unison that it takes the sounds of external
solids, etc. This then proves that the ākāśa is the substratum
of the power of hearing, and also possesses the quality of
sound. And this sameness of the situation of sound is an
indication of the existence of ākāśa as that which is the substratum
of the auditory power (<i>śruti</i>) which manifests the
sounds of the same class in ākāśa. Such a manifestation of
sound cannot be without such an auditory sense-power.
Nor is such an auditory power a quality of pṛthivī (earth),
etc., because it cannot be in its own self both the manifestor
and the manifested (<i>vyahṅgya</i> and <i>vyañjaka</i>), <cite>Tattvavaiśāradī</cite>,
III. 41. It is the auditory power which manifests all sounds
with the help of the ākāśa of the sense organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theory of the guṇas was accepted by many others
outside the Sāṃkhya-Yoga circle and they also offered their
opinions on the nature of the categories.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are thus other views prevalent about the genesis of
the senses, to which it may be worth our while to pay some
attention as we pass by.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sāttvika ego in generating the cognitive senses with
limited powers for certain specified objects of sense only accounted
for their developments from itself in accompaniment
with the specific tanmātras. Thus</p>

<p class='c007'>sāttvika ego + sound potential (śabda-tanmātra) = sense
of hearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>sāttvika ego + touch potential (śparś-tanmātra) = sense of
touch.</p>

<p class='c007'>sāttvika ego + sight potential (śrūpa-tanmātra) = sense of
vision.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>sāttvika ego + taste potential (vasa-tanmātra) = sense of
taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>sāttvika ego + smell potential (gandha-tanmātra) = sense of
smell.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conative sense of speech is developed in association
with the sense of hearing; that of hand in association with the
sense of touch; that of feet in association with the sense of
vision; that of upastha in association with the sense of taste;
that of pāyu in association with the sense of smell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last of all, the manas is developed from the ego without
any co-operating or accompanying cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Naiyāyikas, however, think that the senses are generated
by the gross elements, the ear for example by ākāśa, the touch
by air and so forth. But Lokācāryya in his <cite>Tattvatraya</cite> holds
that the senses are not generated by gross matter but are
rather sustained and strengthened by it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are others who think that the ego is the instrumental
and that the gross elements are the material causes in the
production of the senses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The view of the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> is, I believe, now quite clear
since we see that the mahat through the asmitā generates from
the latter (as differentiations from it, though it itself exists
as integrated in the mahat), the senses, and their corresponding
gross elements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before proceeding further to trace the development of
the bhūtādi on the tanmātric side, I think it is best to refer
to the views about the supposed difference between the Yoga
and the views of the Sāṃkhya works about the evolution of
the categories. Now according to the Yoga view two parallel
lines of evolution start from mahat, one of which develops
into the ego, manas, the five cognitive and the five conative
senses, while on the other side it develops into the five grosser
elements through the five tanmātras which are directly
produced from mahat through the medium ahaṃkāra.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Thus the view as found in the Yoga works may be tabulated
thus:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_059a.jpg' alt='Prakṛti  Mahat or Asmitāmātra  Asmitā Tanmātras--5  11 senses 5 gross elements' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The view of the Śaṃkhya works may be tabulated thus:--</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_059b.jpg' alt='Prakṛti  Mahat  Ego  11 senses 5 Tanmātras  5 gross elements' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The place in the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> which refers to this genesis
is that under <i>viśeshāviśeshaliṅgamātrāliṅgāni guṇaparvāṇi</i>, II.
19. There it says that the four bhūtas are ether, air, fire,
water and earth. These are the viśeshas (specialised modifications)
of the unspecialised modifications the tanmātras of
sound, touch, colour, taste and smell. So also are the cognitive
senses of hearing, touch, eye, tongue, and nose and the conative
senses of speech, hand, feet, anus and the generative organ.
The eleventh one manas (the co-ordinating organ) has for its
object the objects of all the above ten senses. So these are
the specialised modifications (<i>viśeshas</i>) of the unspecialised
(aviśesha) asmitā. The guṇas have these sixteen kinds of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>specialised modifications (<i>viśeshapariṇāma</i>). The six unspecialised
modifications are the sound tanmātra, touch
tanmātra, colour tanmātra, taste tanmātra and smell tanmātra.
These tanmātras respectively contain one, two,
three, four, and five special characteristics. The sixth
unspecialised modification is asmitāmātra. These are the
six aviśesha evolutions of the pure being, the mahat. The
category of mahat is merely a sign beyond the aviśeshas and
it is there that these exist and develop.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> the fully specialised ones, viśeshas,
the grosser elements are said to have been derived from the
tanmātras and the senses and manas, the faculty of reflection
are said to have been specialised from the ego or
asmitā. The tanmātras, however, have not been derived from
the ego or asmitā here. But they together with asmitā are
spoken of as the six slightly specialised ones, the five being the
five tanmātras and the sixth one being the ego. These six
aviśeshas are the specialisations of the mahat, the great
egohood of pure Be-ness. It therefore appears that the six
aviśeshas are directly derived from the mahat, after which the
ego develops into the eleven senses and the tanmātras into the
five gross elements in three different lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>But let us see how <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> explains the point here:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“But like the senses the tanmātras are also special
modifications of the ahaṃkāra having specially modified
characteristics such as sound, touch, etc., why, therefore, are
they not mentioned as special modifications (<i>viśeshas</i>)? The
answer is that those only are mentioned as special modification
which are ultimate special modifications. The tanmātras are
indeed the special modifications of the ego, but they themselves
produce further special modifications, the bhūtas. The
aviśeshas are explained as the six aviśeshas. The tanmātras
are generated from the tāmasa ahaṃkāra gradually through
sound, etc. The category of mahat which is the ground of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>all modifications, called also the buddhi, has six evolutionary
products called the aviśeshas. Though the mahat and the
prakṛti may also be regarded as the root-causes out of which
the tanmātras have evolved, yet the word aviśesha is used
as a technical term having a special application to the six
aviśeshas only.” The modifications of these are from the
buddhi through the intermediate stage of the ahaṃkāra, as
has been explained in the <cite>Bhāshya</cite>, I. 45.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we see that the <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> says that the <cite>Bhāshya</cite>
is here describing the modifications of buddhi in two distinct
classes, the aviśeshas and the viśeshas; and that the mahat
has been spoken of as the source of all the aviśeshas, the five
tanmātras and the ego; strictly speaking, however, the
genesis of the tanmātras from mahat takes place through the
ego and in association with the ego, for it has been so described
in the <cite>Bhāshya</cite>, I. 45.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nāgeśa in explaining this <cite>Bhāshya</cite> only repeats the view
of <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now let us refer to the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> of I. 45, alluded to by
the <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>: “The gradual series of subtler causes
proceeds up to the aliṅga or the prakṛti. The earth atom
has the smell tanmātra as its subtle cause; the water atom
has the taste tanmātra; the air atom the touch tanmātra;
the ākāśa atom the sound tanmātra; and of these ahaṃkāra
is the subtle cause; and of this the mahat is the subtle
cause.” Here by subtle cause (<i>sūkshma</i>) it is upādānakāraṇa
or material cause which is meant; so the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> further
says: “It is true that purusha is the subtlest of all. But
yet as prakṛti is subtler than the mahat, it is not in that sense
that purusha is subtler than prakṛti for purusha is only an
instrumental cause of the evolution of mahat, but not its
material cause.” I believe it is quite clear that ahaṃkāra
is spoken of here as the <i>sūkshma anvayikārana</i> of the tanmātras.
This anvayikāraṇa is the same as upādāna (material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>cause) as Vācaspati calls it. Now again in the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> of
the same <i>sūtra</i> II. 19 later on we see the liṅga or the mahat is
the stage next to prakṛti, it is differentiated from it though
still remaining integrated in the regular order of evolution.
The six aviśeshas are again differentiated while still remaining
integrated in the mahat in the order of evolution (<i>pariṇāmakramaniyama</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>The mahat tattva (liṅga) is associated with the prakṛti
(aliṅga). Its development is thus to be considered as the
production of a differentiation as integrated within the
prakṛti. The six aviśeshas are also to be considered as the
production of successive differentiations as integrated within
the mahat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words <i>saṃsṛshṭa vivicyante</i> are the most important
here for they show us the real nature of the transformations.
“<cite>Saṃsṛshtā</cite>” means integrated and “<i>vivicyante</i>” means
differentiated. This shows that the order of evolution as
found in the Sāṃkhya works (viz. mahat from prakṛti, ahaṃkāra
from mahat and the eleven senses and the tanmātras
from ahaṃkāra) is true only in this sense that these modifications
of ahaṃkāra take place directly as differentiations of
characters in the body of mahat. As these differentiations
take place through ahaṃkāra as the first moment in the
series of transformations it is said that the transformations
take place directly from ahaṃkāra; whereas when stress
is laid on the other aspect it appears that the transformations
are but differentiations as integrated in the body of the
mahat, and thus it is also said that from mahat the six aviśeshas—namely,
ahaṃkāra and the five tanmātras—come out.
This conception of evolution as differentiation within integration
bridges the gulf between the views of Yoga and the
Saṃkhya works. We know that the tanmātras are produced
from the tāmasa ahaṃkāra. This ahaṃkāra is nothing but the
tāmasa side of mahat roused into creative activity by rajas.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The sāttvika ahaṃkāra is given as a separate category producing
the senses, whereas the tamas as bhūtādi produces the
tanmātras from its disturbance while held up within the
mahat.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Nāgeśa in the <cite>Chāyā-vyākhyā</cite> of II. 19, however, follows
the Sāṃkhya explanation. He says: “The five tanmātras
having in order one, two, three, four and five characteristics
are such that the preceding ones are the causes of the succeeding
ones. The śabdatanmātra has only the characteristic of
sound, the sparśatanmātra of sound and touch and so on....
All these tanmātras are produced from the tāmasa ahaṃkāra
in the order of śabda, sparśa, etc.” This ignores the interpretation
of the <cite>Vyāsā-bhāshya</cite> that the tanmātras are differentiations
within the integrated whole of mahat through the
intermediary stage of the tāmasa ahaṃkāra.</p>

<p class='c006'>The order of the evolution of the tanmātras as here referred
to is as follows:—</p>

    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The evolution of the tanmātras has been variously described
in the Purāṇas and the Smṛti literature. These divergent
views can briefly be brought under two headings: those which
derive the tanmātras from the bhûtas and those which derive
them from the ahaṃkāra and the bhûtas from them. Some
of these schools have been spoken of in the Barabara Muni’s
commentary on the <cite>Tattvatraya</cite>—a treatise on the Rāmānuja
Philosophy—and have been already explained in a systematic
way by Dr. B. N. Seal. I therefore refrain from repeating
them needlessly. About the derivation of the tanmātras all
the other Sāṃkhya treatises, the <cite>Kārikā</cite>, the <cite>Kaumudī</cite>, the
<cite>Tattvavaiśāradī</cite>, the <cite>Sūtra</cite> and <cite>Pravacana-bhāshya</cite>, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><cite>Siddhāntacandrikā</cite>, <cite>Sūtrārthabodhinī</cite>, the <cite>Rajamārtaṇḍa</cite> and
the <cite>Maṇiprabhā</cite> seem to be silent. Further speaking of the
tanmātras, Vijñāna Bhikshu says that the tanmātras exist
only in unspecialised forms; they therefore can be neither
felt nor perceived in any way by the senses of ordinary men.
This is that indeterminate state of matter in which they can
never be distinguished one from the other, and they cannot
be perceived to be possessed of different qualities or specialised
in any way. It is for this that they are called tanmātras, i.e.
their only specialization is a mere thatness. The Yogins
alone perceive them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now turning towards the further evolution of the grosser
elements from the tanmātras, we see that there are great
divergences of view here also, some of which are shown
below. Thus Vācaspati says: “The earth atom is produced
from the five tanmātras with a predominance of the smell
tanmātra, the water atom from the four tanmātras excepting
the smell tanmātra with a preponderance of the taste tanmātra,
and so on” (I. 44).</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus here we find that the ākāśa atom (aṇu) has been
generated simply by the ākāśa tanmātra; the vāyu atom
has been generated by two tanmātras, śabda and sparśa,
of which the sparśa appears there as the chief. The tejas
atom has been developed from the śabda, sparśa and rûpa
tanmātras, though the rûpa is predominant in the group.
The ap atom has been developed from the four tanmātras,
śabda, sparśa, rûpa and rasa, though rasa is predominant
in the group, and the earth or kshiti atom has been developed
from the five tanmātras, though the gandha tanmātra is
predominant in the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> agrees with Vācaspati in all these
details, but differs from him only in maintaining that the
ākāśa atom has been generated from the śabda tanmātra
with an accretion from bhūtādi, whereas Vācaspati says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>that the ākāśa atom is generated simply by the ākāśa
tanmātra.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Nāgeśa, however, takes a slightly different view and says
that to produce the gross atoms from the tanmātras, an
accretion of bhūtādi as an accompanying agent is necessary
at every step; so that we see that the vāyu atom is produced
from these three: śabda + sparśa + accretion from bhūtādi.
Tejas atom = śabda + śparśa + rūpa + accretion from bhūtādi.
Ap atom = śabda + śparśa + rūpa + rasa + accretion from
bhūtādi. Kshiti atom = śabda + śparśa + rūpa + rasa +
gandha + accretion from bhūtādi.</p>

<p class='c007'>I refrain from giving the <cite>Vishṇu Purāṇa</cite> view which has
also been quoted in the <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, and the view of a certain
school of Vedāntists mentioned in the <cite>Tattva-nirūpaṇa</cite> and
referred to and described in the <cite>Tattvatraya</cite>, as Dr. B. N.
Seal has already described them in his article.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see thus that from bhūtādi come the five tanmātras
which can be compared to the Vaiśeshika atoms as they
have no parts and neither grossness nor visible differentiation.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
Some differentiation has of course already begun in the
tanmātras, as they are called śabda, śparśa, rūpa, rasa and
gandha, which therefore may be said to belong to a class akin
to the grosser elements of ākāśa, vāyu, tejas, ap and
kshiti.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The next one, the paramāṇu (atom), which is gross in its
nature and is generated from the tanmātras which exist in
it as parts (<i>tanmātrāvayava</i>) may be compared with the
trasareṇu of the Vaiśeshikas. Thus the <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> says:
“this is called paramāṇu by the Vaiśeshikas. We however
call the subtlest part of the visible earth, earth atoms”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>(IV. 14). The doctrine of atoms is recognised both in the
<cite>Yoga-sūtrās</cite> (I. 46) and the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> (III. 52, IV. 14, etc.).</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether Sāṃkhya admitted the paramāṇus (atoms) or not
cannot be definitely settled. The <cite>Sāṃkhya-kārikā</cite> does not
mention the paramāṇus, but Vijñāna Bhikshu thinks that
the word “<i>sūkshma</i>” in <cite>Kārikā</cite>, 39, means paramāṇus
(<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, IV. 14). Though the word paramāṇu is not
mentioned in the <cite>Kārikā</cite>, I can hardly suppose that Sāṃkhya
did not admit it in the sense in which Yoga did. For it does
not seem probable that Sāṃkhya should think that by the
combination of the subtle tanmātras we could all at once
have the bigger lumps of bhūta without there being any
particles. Moreover, since the Yoga paramāṇus are the
finest visible particles of matter it could not have been
denied by Sāṃkhya. The supposition of some German
scholars that Sāṃkhya did not admit the paramāṇus does
not seem very plausible. Bhikshu in <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, III. 52,
says that the guṇas are in reality Vaiśeshika atoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third form is gross air, fire, water, etc., which is said
to belong to the mahat (gross) class. I cannot express it
better than by quoting a passage from <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, IV. 4:
“The <cite>Bhāshya</cite> holds that in the tanmātras there exists the
specific differentiation that constitutes the five tanmātras,
the kshiti atom is generated and by the conglomeration of
these gross atoms gross earth is formed. So again by the combination
of the four tanmātras the water atom is formed and
the conglomeration of these water atoms makes gross water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It should be noted here: since the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> holds that the
tanmātras of sound, etc., are of the same class as the corresponding
gross elements it may be assumed that the combining
tanmātras possess the class characteristics which are made
manifest in gross elements by hardness, smoothness, etc.”
Bhikshu holds that since Sāṃkhya and Yoga are similar (<i>samānatantra</i>)
this is to be regarded as being also the Sāṃkhya view.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>There is, however, another measure which is called the
measure of parama mahat, which belongs to ākāśa for example.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now these paramāṇus or atoms are not merely atoms of
matter but they contain within themselves those particular
qualities by virtue of which they appear, as pleasant, unpleasant
or passive to us. If we have expressed ourselves
clearly, I believe it has been shown that when the inner and
the outer proceed from one source, the ego and the external
world do not altogether differ in nature from the inner; both
have been formed by the collocation of the guṇas (<i>sarvamidaṃ
guṇānāṃ sanniveśaviseshamātram</i>). The same book which in
the inner microcosm is written in the language of ideas has
been in the external world written in the language of matter.
So in the external world we have all the grounds of our inner
experience, cognitive as well as emotional, pleasurable as well
as painful. The modifications of the external world are only
translated into ideas and feelings; therefore these paramāṇus
are spoken of as endowed with feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another difference between the tanmātras and the
paramāṇus. The former cannot be perceived to be endowed
with the feeling elements as the latter. Some say, however,
that it is not true that the tanmātras are not endowed with
the feeling elements, but they cannot be perceived by any save
the Yogins; thus it is said: <i>tanmātrāṇāmapi parasparavyāvṛttasvabhāvatvamastyeva
tacca yogimātragamyam</i>. The tanmātras
also possess differentiated characters, but they can be perceived
only by the Yogins; but this is not universally admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now these paramāṇus cannot further be evolved into any
other different kind of existence or tattvāntara.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a> We see
that the paramāṇus though they have been formed from
the tanmātras resemble them only in a very remote way and
are therefore placed in a separate stage of evolution.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>With the bhūtas we have the last stage of evolution of the
guṇas. The course of evolution, however, does not cease here,
but continues ceaselessly, though by its process no new stage
of existence is generated, but the product of the evolution
is such that in it the properties of the gross elements which
compose its constitution can be found directly. This is what
is called <i>dharmapariṇāma</i>, as distinguished from the <i>tattvāntara-pariṇāma</i>
spoken above. The evolution of the
viśeshas from the aviśeshas is always styled tattvāntara-pariṇāma,
as opposed to the evolution that takes place among
the viśeshas themselves, which is called <i>dharmapariṇāma</i> or
evolution by change of qualities. Now these atoms or
paramāṇus of kshiti, ap, tejas, marut or ākāśa conglomerate
together and form all sentient or non-sentient bodies in the
world. The different atoms of earth, air, fire, water, etc.,
conglomerate together and form the different animate bodies
such as cow, etc., or inanimate bodies such as jug, etc., and
vegetables like the tree, etc. These bodies are built up by
the conglomerated units of the atoms in such a way that they
are almost in a state of combination which has been styled
<i>ayutasiddhāvayava</i>. In such a combination the parts do not
stand independently, but only hide themselves as it were in
order to manifest the whole body, so that by the conglomeration
of the particles we have what may be called a body,
which is regarded as quite a different thing from the atoms
of which it is composed. These bodies change with the different
sorts of change or arrangement of the particles, according
to which the body may be spoken of as “one,” “large,”
“small,” “tangible” or “possessing” the quality of action.
Some philosophers hold the view that a body is really nothing
but the conglomeration of the atoms; but they must be
altogether wrong here since they have no right to ignore the
“body,” which appears before them with all its specific
qualities and attributes; moreover, if they ignore the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>they have to ignore almost everything, for the atoms themselves
are not visible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, these atoms, though so much unlike the Vaiśeshika
atoms since they contain tanmātras of a different nature as
their constituents and thus differ from the simpler atoms of
the Vaiśeshikas, compose the constituents of all inorganic,
organic or animal bodies in such a way that there is no break
of harmony—no opposition between them;—but, on the
contrary, when any one of the guṇas existing in the atoms
and their conglomerations becomes prominent, the other
guṇas though their functions are different from it, yet do not
run counter to the prominent guṇas, but conjointly with them,
help to form the specific modification for the experiences of
the purusha. In the production of a thing, the different
guṇas do not choose different independent courses for their
evolution, but join together and effectuate themselves in the
evolution of a single product. Thus we see also that when
the atoms of different gross elements possessing different
properties and attributes coalesce, their difference of attributes
does not produce confusion, but they unite in the
production of the particular substances by a common
teleological purpose (see <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, IV. 14).</p>

<p class='c007'>We thus see that the bodies or things composed by the
collocation of the atoms in one sense differ from the atoms
themselves and in another are identical with the atoms
themselves. We see therefore that the appearance of the
atoms as bodies or things differs with the change of position
of the atoms amongst themselves. So we can say that the
change of the appearance of things and bodies only shows
the change of the collocation of the atoms, there being always
a change of appearance in the bodies consequent on every
change in the position of the atoms. The former therefore
is only an explicit appearance of the change that takes place
in the substance itself; for the appearance of a thing is only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>an explicit aspect of the very selfsame thing—the atoms;
thus the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> says: <i>dharmisvarūpamātro hi dharmaḥ,
dharmivrikriyā eva eshā dharmadvārā prapañcyate</i>, i.e. a
dharma (quality) is merely the nature of the dharmin
(substance), and it is the changes of the dharmin that are
made explicit by the dharmas.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Often it happens that
the change of appearance of a thing or a body, a tree or a
piece of cloth, for example, can be marked only after a long
interval. This, however, only shows that the atoms of the
body had been continually changing and consequently the
appearance of the body or the thing also had been continually
changing; for otherwise we can in no way account for the
sudden change of appearance. All bodies are continually
changing the constituent collocation of atoms and their
appearances. In the smallest particle of time or kshaṇa the
whole universe undergoes a change. Each moment or the
smallest particle of time is only the manifestation of that
particular change. Time therefore has not a separate existence
in this philosophy as in the Vaiśeshika, but it is only
identical with the smallest amount of change—viz. that of
an atom of its own amount of space. Now here the appearance
is called the dharma, and that particular arrangement of
atoms or guṇas which is the basis of the particular appearance
is called the dharmin. The change of appearance is therefore
called the dharma-pariṇāma.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Again this change of appearance can be looked at from
two other aspects which though not intrinsically different
from the change of appearance have their own special points
of view which make them remarkable. These are <i>lakshaṇa-pariṇāma</i>
and <i>avasthā-pariṇāma</i>. Taking the particular collocation
of atoms in a body for review, we see that all the subsequent
changes that take place in it exist in it only in a latent
way in it which will be manifested in future. All the previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>changes of the collocating atoms are not also lost but exist
only in a sublatent way in the particular collocation of atoms
present before us. For the past changes are by no means
destroyed but are preserved in the peculiar and particular
collocation of atoms of the present moment. For had not the
past changes taken place, the present could not appear. The
present had held itself hidden in the past just as the future
is hidden within the present. It therefore only comes into
being with the unfolding of the past, which therefore exists
only in a sublatent form in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is on account of this that we see that a body comes into
being and dies away. Though this birth or death is really
subsumed the change of appearance yet it has its own special
aspect, on account of which it has been given a separate name
as lakshaṇa-pariṇāma. It considers the three stages of an
appearance—the unmanifested when it exists in the future,
the manifested moment of the present, and the past when it
has been manifested—lost to view but preserved and retained
in all the onward stages of the evolution. Thus when we say
that a thing has not yet come into being, that it has just come
into being, and that it is no longer, we refer to this lakshaṇa-pariṇāma
which records the history of the thing in future,
present and past, which are only the three different moments
of the same thing according to its different characters, as
unmanifested, manifested and manifested in the past but
conserved.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it often happens that though the appearance of a
thing is constantly changing owing to the continual change
of the atoms that compose it, yet the changes are so fine and
infinitesimal that they cannot be marked by anyone except
the Yogins; for though structural changes may be going on
tending towards the final passing away of that structure and
body into another structure and body, which greatly differs
from it, yet they may not be noticed by us, who can take note
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of the bigger changes alone. Taking therefore two remarkable
stages of things, the difference between which may
be so notable as to justify us in calling the later the dissolution
or destruction of the former, we assert that the thing has
suffered growth and decay in the interval, during which the
actual was passing into the sublatent and the potential was
tending towards actualization. This is what is called the
avasthā-pariṇāma, or change of condition, which, however,
does not materially differ from the lakshaṇa-pariṇāma and can
thus be held to be a mode of it. It is on account of this that
a substance is called new or old, grown or decayed. Thus
in explaining the illustration given in the <cite>Bhāshya</cite>, III. 13:
“there is avasthā-pariṇāma. At the moments of cessation
the potencies of cessation become stronger and those of
ordinary experience weaker.” The <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> says:
“The strength and weakness of the two potencies is like the
newness or oldness of a jug; growth and decay being the
same as origination and decease, there is no difference here
from <i>lakshaṇa-pariṇāma</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is now time for us to examine once more the relation of
dharmin, substance, and dharma, its quality or appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dharmin, or substance, is that which remains common
to the latent (as having passed over or <i>śānta</i>), the rising
(the present or <i>udita</i>) and the unpredicable (future or <i>avyapadeśya</i>)
characteristic qualities of the substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Substance (take for example, earth) has the power of
existing in the form of particles of dust, a lump or a jug by
which water may be carried. Now taking the stage of lump
for examination we may think of its previous stage, that of
particles of dust, as being latent, and its future stage as jug
as the unpredicable. The earth we see here to be common
to all these three stages which have come into being by its
own activity and consequent changes. Earth here is the
common quality which remains unchanged in all these stages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and so relatively constant among its changes as particles,
lump and jug. This earth therefore is regarded as the
dharmin, characterised one, the substance; and its stages
as its dharma or qualities. When this dharmin, or substance,
undergoes a change from a stage of lump to a stage
of jug, it undergoes what is called <i>dharma-pariṇāma</i> or change
of quality.</p>

<p class='c007'>But its dharma, as the shape of the jug may be thought
to have itself undergone a change—inasmuch as it has now
come into being, from a state of relative non-being, latency
or unpredicability. This is called the lakshaṇa-pariṇāma of
the dharma or qualities as constituting a jug. This jug is
again suffering another change as new or old according as
it is just produced or is gradually running towards its dissolution,
and this is called the avasthā-pariṇāma or change of
condition. These three, however, are not separate from the
dharma-pariṇāma, but are only aspects of it; so it may
be said that the dharmin or substance directly suffers the
dharma-pariṇāma and indirectly the lakshaṇa and the avasthā-pariṇāma.
The dharma, however, changes and the lakshaṇa-pariṇāma
can be looked at from another point of view,
that of change of state, viz. growth and decay. Thus we see
that though the atoms of kshiti, ap, etc., remain unchanged,
they are constantly suffering changes from the inorganic to
plants and animals, and from thence again back to the inorganic.
There is thus a constant circulation of changes in
which the different atoms of kshiti, ap, tejas, vāyu and
ākāśa remaining themselves unchanged are suffering dharma-pariṇāma
as they are changed from the inorganic to plants
and animals and back again to the inorganic. These different
states or dharmas (as inorganic, etc.), again, according as they
are not yet, now, or no longer or passed over, are suffering
the lakshaṇa-pariṇāma. There is also the avasthā-pariṇāma
of these states according as any one of them (the plant state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>for example) is growing or suffering decay towards its dissolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>This circulation of cosmic matter in general applies also to
all particular things, such as the jug, the cloth, etc.; the order
of evolution here will be that of powdered particles of earth,
lump of earth, the earthen jug, the broken halves of the jug,
and again the powdered earth. As the whole substance has
only one identical evolution, these different states only happen
in order of succession, the occurrence of one characteristic
being displaced by another characteristic which comes after it
immediately. We thus see that one substance may undergo
endless changes of characteristic in order of succession; and
along with the change of characteristic or dharma we have the
lakshaṇa-pariṇāma and the avasthā-pariṇāma as old or new,
which is evidently one of infinitesimal changes of growth and
decay. Thus Vācaspati gives the following beautiful example:
“Even the most carefully preserved rice in the granary
becomes after long years so brittle that it crumbles into atoms.
This change cannot happen to new rice all on a sudden. Therefore
we have to admit an order of successive changes” (<cite>Tattvavaivśāradī</cite>,
III. 15).</p>

<p class='c007'>We now see that substance has neither past nor future;
appearances or qualities only are manifested in time, by virtue
of which substance is also spoken of as varying and changing
temporally, just as a line remains unchanged in itself but
acquires different significances according as one or two zeros
are placed on its right side. Substance—the atoms of kshiti,
ap, tejas, marut, vyoman, etc., by various changes of quality
appear as the manifold varieties of cosmical existence. There
is no intrinsic difference between one thing and another, but
only changes of character of one and the same thing; thus the
gross elemental atoms like water and earth particles acquire
various qualities and appear as the various juices of all fruits
and herbs. Now in analogy with the arguments stated above,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>it will seem that even a qualified thing or appearance may be
relatively regarded as substance, when it is seen to remain
common to various other modifications of that appearance
itself. Thus a jug, which may remain common in all its
modifications of colour, may be regarded relatively as the
dharmin or substance of all these special appearances or
modifications of the same appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>We remember that the guṇas, which are the final substratum
of all the grosser particles, are always in a state of
commotion and always evolving in the manner previously
stated, for the sake of the experience and final realisation of
the parusha, the only object or end of the prakṛti. Thus the
<cite>Bhāshya</cite>, III. 13, says: “So it is the nature of the guṇas that
there cannot remain even a moment without the evolutionary
changes of dharma, lakshaṇa and avasthā; movement is the
characteristic of the guṇas. The nature of the guṇas is the
cause of their constant movement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the pioneers of modern scientific evolution have
tried to observe scientifically some of the stages of the growth
of the inorganic and of the animal worlds into the man, yet
they do not give any reason for it. Theirs is more an experimental
assertion of facts than a metaphysical account of
evolution. According to Darwin the general form of the
evolutionary process is that which is accomplished by “very
slight variations which are accumulated by the effect of natural
selection.” And according to a later theory, we see that a new
species is constituted all at once by the simultaneous appearance
of several new characteristics very different from the old.
But why this accidental variation, this seeming departure from
the causal chain, comes into being, the evolutionists cannot
explain. But the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala doctrine explains it
from the standpoint of teleology or the final goal inherent in all
matter, so that it may be serviceable to the purusha. To be
serviceable to the purusha is the one moral purpose in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>prakṛti and its manifestations in the whole material world,
which guide the course and direction of the smallest particle
of matter. From the scientific point of view, the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala
doctrine is very much in the same position as
modern science, for it does not explain the cause of the
accidental variation noticed in all the stages of evolutionary
process from any physical point of view based on the observation
of facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it does much credit to the Pātañjala doctrines that they
explain this accidental variation, this <i>avyapadeśyatva</i> or
unpredicability of the onward course of evolution from a
moral point of view, that of teleology, the serviceability of the
purusha. They found, however, that this teleology should not
be used to usurp the whole nature and function of matter.
We find that the atoms are always moving by virtue of the
rajas or energy, and it is to this movement of the atoms in space
that all the products of evolution are due. We have found
that the difference between the juices of Coco-nut, Palm, Bel,
Tinduka (Diospyros Embryopteries), Āmalaka (Emblic Myrobalan)
can be accounted for by the particular and peculiar
arrangement of the atoms of earth and water alone, by their
stress and strain; and we see also that the evolution of the
organic from the inorganic is due to this change of position of
the atoms themselves; for the unit of change is the change
in an atom of its own dimension of spatial position. There is
always the transformation of energy from the inorganic to the
organic and back again from the organic. Thus the differences
among things are solely due to the different stages which they
occupy in the scale of evolution, as different expressions of the
transformation of energy; but virtually there is no intrinsic
difference among things <i>sarvaṃ sarvātmakaṃ</i>; the change of
the collocation of atoms only changes potentiality into
actuality, for there is potentiality of everything for
every thing everywhere throughout this changing world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Thus Vācaspati writes: “The water possessing taste,
colour, touch and sound and the earth possessing smell,
taste, colour, touch, and sound suffer an infinite variety
of changes as roots, flowers, fruits, leaves and their
specific tastes and other qualities. The water and the
earth which do not possess these qualities cannot have
them, for we have proved that what is non-existent cannot
come into being. The trees and plants produce the varied
tastes and colours in animals, for it is by eating these that they
acquire such richness of colour, etc. Animal products can again
produce changes in plant bodies. By sprinkling blood on it a
pomegranate may be made as big as a palm” (<cite>Tattvavaiśaradī</cite>,
III. 14).</p>

<p class='c007'>Looked at from the point of view of the guṇas, there is no
intrinsic difference between things, though there are a thousand
manifestations of differences, according to time, place, form
and causality. The expressions of the guṇas, and the manifestations
of the transformations of energy differ according to
time, place, shape, or causality—these are the determining
circumstances and environments which determine the modes
of the evolutionary process; surrounding environments are
also involved in determining this change, and it is said that
two Āmalaka fruits placed in two different places undergo two
different sorts of changes in connection with the particular
spots in which they are placed, and that if anybody interchanges
them a Yogin can recognise and distinguish the one
from the other by seeing the changes that the fruits have
undergone in connection with their particular points of space.
Thus the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> says: “Two Āmalaka fruits having the
same characteristic genus and species, their situation in two
different points of space contributes to their specific distinction
of development, so that they may be identified as this and
that. When an Āmalaka is brought from a distance to a man
previously inattentive to it, he naturally cannot distinguish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>this Āmalaka as being the distant one which has been
brought before him without his knowledge. But right knowledge
should be competent to discern the distinction;
and the sūtra says that the place associated with one
Āmalaka fruit is different from the place associated with
another Āmalaka at another point of space; and the Yogin
can perceive the difference of their specific evolution in
association with their points of space; similarly the atoms also
suffer different modifications at different points of space which
can be perceived by Īśvara and the Yogins” (<cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>,
III. 53).</p>

<p class='c007'>Vācaspati again says: “Though all cause is essentially all
effects yet a particular cause takes effect in a particular place,
thus though the cause is the same, yet saffron grows in
Kāśmīra and not in Pāñcāla. So, the rains do not come in
summer, the vicious do not enjoy happiness. Thus in accordance
with the obstructions of place, time, animal form, and
instrumental accessories, the same cause does not produce the
same effect. Though as cause everything is essentially everything
else, yet there is a particular country for a particular
effect, such as Kāśmīra is for saffron. Even though the
causes may be in other countries such as Pāñcāla, yet the effect
will not happen there, and for this reason saffron does not
manifest itself in Pāñcāla. So in summer there are no rains and
so no paddy grows then” (<cite>Tattvavaiśāradī</cite>, III. 14).</p>

<p class='c007'>We see therefore that time, space, etc., are the limitations
which regulate, modify and determine to a certain extent the
varying transformations and changes and the seeming differences
of things, though in reality they are all ultimately
reducible to the three guṇas; thus Kāśmīra being the
country of saffron, it will not grow in the Pāñcāla country,
even though the other causes of its growth should all be
present there;—here the operation of cause is limited by
space.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>After considering the inorganic, vegetable and animal
kingdoms as three stages in the evolutionary process, our
attention is at once drawn to their conception of the nature of
relation of plant life to animal life. Though I do not find any
special reference in the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> to this point, yet I am
reminded of a few passages in the <cite>Mahābhārata</cite>, which I think
may be added as a supplement to the general doctrine of
evolution according to the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala philosophy as
stated here. Thus the <cite>Mahābhārata</cite> says: “Even the solid
trees have ether (ākāśa) in them which justifies the regular
appearance of flowers and fruits. By heat the leaves, the
bark, flowers and fruits become withered, and since there is
withering and decay in them, there is in them the sensation of
touch. Since by the sound of air, fire and thunder the fruits
and flowers fall away, there must be the sense of hearing in
them. The creepers encircle the trees and they go in all directions,
and since without sight there could not be any choice
of direction, the trees have the power of vision. By various
holy and unholy smells and incenses of various kinds the trees
are cured of their diseases and blossom forth, therefore the
trees can smell. Since they drink by their roots, and since they
get diseases, and since their diseases can be cured, there is the
sense of taste in the trees. Since they enjoy pleasure and
suffer pain, and since their parts which are cut grow, I see life
everywhere in trees and not want of life” (<cite>Sāntiparva</cite>, 184).</p>

<p class='c007'>Nīlakaṇṭha in his commentary goes still further and says
that a hard substance called vajramaṇi also may be called
living. Here we see that the ancients had to a certain extent
forestalled the discovery of Sir J. C. Bose that the life functions
differed only in degree between the three classes, the
inorganic, plants and animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are all, however, only illustrations of dharma-pariṇāma,
for here there is no radical change in the elements
themselves, the appearance of qualities being due only to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>different arrangement of the atoms of the five gross elements.
This change applies to the viśeshas only—the five gross
elements externally and the eleven senses internally. How
the inner microcosm, the manas and the senses are affected by
dharma-pariṇāma we shall see hereafter, when we deal with
the psychology of the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala doctrine. For the
present it will suffice to say that the citta or mind also suffers
this change and is modified in a twofold mode; the patent in
the form of the ideas and the latent, as the substance itself, in
the form of saṃskāras of subconscious impressions. Thus the
<cite>Bhāshya</cite> says: “The mind has two kinds of characteristics,
perceived and unperceived. Those of the nature of ideas are
perceived and those inherent in the integral nature of it are
unperceived. The latter are of seven kinds and may be
ascertained by inference. These are cessation of mental states
by samādhi, virtue and vice, subconscious impressions,
change, life-functioning, power of movement, and energy”
(III. 15).</p>

<p class='c007'>This dharma-pariṇāma as we have shown it, is essentially
different from the satkāraṇavāda of the aviśeshas described
above. We cannot close this discussion about evolution
without noticing the Sāṃkhya view of causation.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen that the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala view holds that
the effect is already existent in the cause, but only in a
potential form. “The grouping or collocation alone changes,
and this brings out the manifestation of the latent powers of
the guṇas, but without creation of anything absolutely new or
non-existent.” This is the true satkāryyavāda theory as
distinguished from the so-called satkāryyavāda theory of the
Vedāntists, which ought more properly to be called the
satkāraṇavāda theory, for with them the cause alone is true,
and all effects are illusory, being only impositions on the cause.
For with them the material cause alone is true, whilst all its
forms and shapes are merely illusory, whereas according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala doctrine all the appearances or effects
are true and are due to the power which the substance has of
transforming itself into those various appearances and effects
<i>yogyatāvacchinnā dharmiṇaḥ śaktireva dharmaḥ</i> (III. 14).
The operation of the concomitant condition or efficient cause
serves only to effect the passage of a thing from potency to
actualisation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everything in the phenomenal world is but a special
collocation of the guṇas; so that the change of collocation
explains the diversity of things. Considered from the point of
view of the guṇas, things are all the same, so excluding that,
the cause of the diversity in things is the power which the
guṇas have of changing their particular collocations and thus
assuming various shapes. We have seen that the prakṛti
unfolds itself through various stages—the mahat called the
great being—the ahaṃkāra, the tanmātras called the
aviśeshas. Now the liṅga at once resolves itself into the
ahaṃkāra and through it again into the tanmātras. The
ahaṃkāra and the tanmātras again resolve themselves into the
senses and the gross elements, and these again are constantly
suffering thousands of modifications called the dharma,
lakshaṇa, and avasthā-pariṇāma according to the definite law
of evolution (<i>pariṇāmakramaniyama</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Now according to the Saṃkhya-Pātañjala doctrine, the
śakti—power, force—and the śaktimān—the possessor of
power or force—are not different but identical. So the prakṛti
and all its emanations and modifications are of the nature of
substantive entities as well as power or force. Their appearances
as substantive entities and as power or force are but
two aspects, and so it will be erroneous to make any such
distinction as the substantive entity and its power or force.
That which is the substantive entity is the force, and that
which is the force is the substantive entity. Of course for all
practical purposes we can indeed make some distinction, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>that distinction is only relatively true. Thus when we say
that earth is the substantive entity and the power which it has
of transforming itself into the produced form, lump, or jug
as its attribute, we see on the one hand that no distinction is
really made between the appearance of the earth as jug and
its power of transforming itself into the jug. As this power of
transforming itself into lump or jug, etc., always abides in the
earth we say that the jug, etc., are also abiding in the earth;
when the power is in the potential state, we say that the jug
is in the potential state, and when it is actualised, we say that
the jug has been actualised. Looked at from the tanmātric
side, the earth and all the other gross elements must be said
to be mere modifications, and as such identical with the
power which the tanmātras have of changing themselves into
them. The potentiality or actuality of any state is the mere
potentiality or actuality of the power which its antecedent
cause has of transforming itself into it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c013'>EVOLUTION AND CHANGE OF QUALITIES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Prakṛti, though a substantive entity is yet a potential power,
being actualised as its various modifications, the aviśeshas and
the viśeshas. Being of the nature of power, the movement by
which it actualises itself is immanent within itself and not
caused from without. The operation of the concomitant
conditions is only manifested in the removal of the negative
barriers by which the power was stopped or prevented from
actualising itself. Being of the nature of power, its potentiality
means that it is kept in equilibrium by virtue of the opposing
tendencies inherent within it, which serve to obstruct one
another and are therefore called the āvaraṇa śakti. Of course
it is evident that there is no real or absolute distinction between
the opposing force (<i>āvaraṇa śakti</i>) and the energising force
(<i>kāryyakarī śakti</i>); they may be called so only relatively, for
the same tendency which may appear as the <i>āvaraṇa śakti</i> of
some tendencies may appear as the <i>kāryyakarī śakti</i> elsewhere.
The example chosen to explain the nature of prakṛti and its
modifications conceived as power tending towards actuality
from potentiality in the <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> is that of a sheet of
water enclosed by temporary walls within a field, but always
tending to run out of it. As soon as the temporary wall is
broken in some direction, the water rushes out of itself, and
what one has to do is to break the wall at a particular place.
Prakṛti is also the potential for all the infinite diversity of
things in the phenomenal world, but the potential tendency of
all these mutually opposed and diverse things cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>actualised together. Owing to the concomitant conditions
when the barrier of a certain tendency is removed, it at once
actualises itself in its effect and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can only expect to get any effect from any cause if the
necessary barriers can be removed, for everything is everything
potentially and it is only necessary to remove the particular
barrier which is obstructing the power from actualising itself
in that particular effect towards which it is always potentially
tending. Thus Nandī who was a man is at once turned into a
god for his particular merit, which served to break all the
barriers of the potential tendency of his body towards becoming
divine, so that the barriers being removed the potential
power of the prakṛti of his body at once actualises itself in the
divine body.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> (III. 14) mentions four sorts of concomitant
conditions which can serve to break the barrier in a
particular way and thus determine the mode or form of the
actualisations of the potential. These are (1) ākāra, form
and constitution of a thing; deśa, place, (3) kāla, time; thus
from a piece of stone, the shoot of a plant cannot proceed, for
the arrangement of the particles in stone is such that it will
oppose and stand as a bar to its potential tendencies to
develop into the shoot of a plant; of course if these barriers
could be removed, say by the will of God, as Vijñāna Bhikshu
says, then it is not impossible that the shoot of a plant might
grow from a stone. By the will of God poison may be turned
into nectar and nectar into poison, and there is no absolute
certainty of the course of the evolutionary process, for God’s
will can make any change in the direction of its process
(<i>avyavasthitākhilapariṇāmo bhavatyeva</i>, III. 14).</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the Sāṃkhya-Pātañjala theory dharma, merit,
can only be said to accrue from those actions which lead to a
man’s salvation, and adharma from just the opposite course
of conduct. When it is said that these can remove the barriers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>of the prakṛti and thus determine its modifications, it amounts
almost to saying that the modifications of the prakṛti are
being regulated by the moral conditions of man. According
to the different stages of man’s moral evolution, different kinds
of merit, dharma or adharma, accrue, and these again
regulate the various physical and mental phenomena according
to which a man may be affected either pleasurably or
painfully. It must, however, be always remembered that the
dharma and adharma are also the productions of prakṛti,
and as such cannot affect it except by behaving as the cause for
the removal of the opposite obstructions—the dharma for
removing the obstructions of adharma and adharma for those
of dharma. Vijñāna Bhikshu and Nāgeśa agree here in
saying that the modifications due to dharma and adharma
are those which affect the bodies and senses. What they mean
is possibly this, that it is dharma or adharma alone which
guides the transformations of the bodies and senses of all
living beings in general and the Yogins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body of a person and his senses are continually decaying
and being reconstructed by refilling from the gross elements
and from ahaṃkāra respectively. These refillings proceed
automatically and naturally; but they follow the teleological
purpose as chalked out by the law of karma in accordance with
the virtues or vices of a man. Thus the gross insult to which
the sages were subjected by Nahusha<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> was so effective a
sin that by its influence the refilling of Nahusha’s body and
the senses was stopped and the body and senses of a snake
were directly produced by a process of refilling from the gross
elements and ahaṃkāra, for providing him with a body in
which he could undergo the sufferings which were his due
owing to the enormity of his vice. Thus by his vicious action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the whole machinery of prakṛti was set in operation so that he
at once died and was immediately reborn as a snake. In
another place Vācaspati “the virtuous enjoys happiness” as
an illustration of the cause of dharma and adharma as
controlling the course of the development of prakṛti. We
therefore see that the sphere of merit and demerit lies in the
helping of the formation of the particular bodies and senses
(from the gross elements and ahaṃkāra respectively) suited to
all living beings according to their stages of evolution and
their growth, decay, or other sorts of their modifications as
pleasure, pain, and also as illness or health. Thus it is by his
particular merit that the Yogin can get his special body or men
or animals can get their new bodies after leaving the old ones
at death. Thus <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> says: “Merit by removing the
obstructions of demerit causes the development of the body
and the senses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As for Īśvara I do not remember that the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> or the
sūtras ever mention Him as having anything to do with the
controlling of the modifications of the prakṛti by removing the
barriers, but all the later commentators agree in holding him
responsible for the removal of all barriers in the way of prakṛtis
development. So that Īśvara is the root cause of all the
removal of barriers, including those that are affected by merit
and demerit. Thus Vācaspati says (IV. 3): <i>Īśvarasyāpi
dharmādhishṭhānārthaṃ pratibandhāpanaya eva vyāpāro</i>, i.e.
God stands as the cause of the removal of such obstacles in the
prakṛti as may lead to the fruition of merit or demerit.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> and Nāgeśa agree in holding Īśvara responsible
for the removal of all obstacles in the way of the evolution of
prakṛti. Thus Bhikshu says that God rouses prakṛti by
breaking the opposing forces of the state of equilibrium and
also of the course of evolution (IV. 3).</p>

<p class='c007'>It is on account of God that we can do good or bad actions
and thus acquire merit or demerit. Of course God is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>active and cannot cause any motion in prakṛti. But He by His
very presence causes the obstacles, as the barriers in the way of
prakṛti’s development, to be removed, in such a way that He
stands ultimately responsible for the removal of all obstacles
in the way of prakṛti’s development and thus also of all
obstacles in the way of men’s performance of good or bad
deeds. Man’s good or bad deeds “puṇyakarma,” apuṇyakarma,
dharma or adharma serve to remove the obstacles
of prakṛti in such a way as to result in pleasurable or painful
effects; but it is by God’s help that the barriers of prakṛti are
removed and it yields itself in such a way that a man may
perform good or bad deeds according to his desire. Nīlakaṇṭha,
however, by his quotations in explanation of 300/2, <cite>Śāntiparva</cite>,
leads us to suppose that he regards God’s will as wholly
responsible for the performance of our good or bad actions.
For if we lay stress on his quotation “He makes him do good
deeds whom He wants to raise, and He makes him commit bad
deeds whom He wants to throw down,” it appears that he
whom God wants to raise is made to perform good actions and
he whom God wants to throw downwards is made to commit
bad actions. But this seems to be a very bold idea, as it
will altogether nullify the least vestige of freedom in and
responsibility for our actions and is unsupported by the
evidence of other commentators. Vijñāna Bhikshu also says
with reference to this śruti in his <cite>Vijñānamṛta-bhāshya</cite>, III. 33:
“As there is an infinite <i>regressus</i> between the causal connection
of seed and shoot, so one karma is being determined by the
previous karma and so on; there is no beginning to this chain.”
So we take the superintendence of merits and demerits (<i>dharmādhispṭhānatā</i>)
by Īśvara to mean only in a general way the
help that is offered by Him in removing the obstructions of the
external world in such a manner that it may be possible for a
man to perform practically meritorious acts in the external
world.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Nīlakaṇṭha commenting on the Yoga view says that “like
a piece of magnet, God though inactive, may by His very
presence stir up prakṛti and help His devotees. So the Yoga
holds that for the granting of emancipation God has to be
admitted” (<cite>Śāntiparva</cite>, 300/2).</p>

<p class='c007'>In support of our view we also find that it is by God’s
influence that the unalterable nature of the external world
is held fast and a limit imposed on the powers of man in
producing changes in the external world. Thus Vācaspati in
explaining the Bhāshya (III. 45) says: “Though capable of
doing it, yet he does not change the order of things, because
another earlier omnipotent being had wished the things to be
such as they were. They would not disobey the orders of the
omnipotent God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Men may indeed acquire unlimited powers of producing
any changes they like, for the powers of objects as they
change according to the difference of class, space, time and
condition, are not permanent, and so it is proper that they
should act in accordance with the desire of the Yogin; but
there is a limit to men’s will by the command of God—thus
far and no further.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another point in our favour is that the Yoga philosophy
differs from the Sāṃkhya mainly in this that the purushārtha
or serviceability to the purusha is only the aim or end of the
evolution of prakṛti and not actually the agent which removes
the obstacles of the prakṛti in such a way as to determine its
course as this cosmical process of evolution. Purushārtha is
indeed the aim for which the process of evolution exists; for
this manifold evolution in its entirety affects the interests of
the purusha alone; but that does not prove that its teleology
can really guide the evolution on its particular lines so as to
ensure the best possible mode of serving all the interests of the
purusha, for this teleology being immanent in the prakṛti is
essentially non-intelligent. Thus Vācaspati says: “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>fulfilment of the purpose of the purusha is not also the prime
mover. God has the fulfilment of the purpose of the purusha as
His own purpose, for which He behaves as the prime mover.
The fulfilment of the purpose of the purusha may be regarded
as cause only in the sense that it is the object in view of God,
the prime mover.”<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Sāṃkhya, however, hopes that this immanent purpose
in prakṛti acts like a blind instinct and is able to guide the
course of its evolution in all its manifold lines in accordance
with the best possible service of the purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Pātañjala view, as we have seen, maintains that
Īśvara removes all obstacles of prakṛti in such a way that this
purpose may find scope for its realisation. Thus <cite>Sūtrārthabodhinī</cite>,
IV. 3, of Nārāyaṇa Tīrtha says: “According to
atheistic Sāṃkhya the future serviceability of purusha alone
is the mover of prakṛti. But with us theists the serviceability
of purusha is the object for which prakṛti moves. It is merely
as an object that the serviceability of the purusha may be said
to be the mover of the prakṛti.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the connection of prakṛti and purusha, however,
both Sāṃkhya and Pātañjala agree according to Vijñāna
Bhikshu in denying the interference of Īśvara; it is the
movement of prakṛti by virtue of immanent purpose that
connects itself naturally with the purusha. Vijñāna Bhikshu’s
own view, however, is that this union is brought about by God
(<cite>Vijñānāmṛta-bhāshya</cite>, p. 34).</p>

<p class='c007'>To recapitulate, we see that there is an immanent purpose
in prakṛti which connects it with the purushas. This purpose
is, however, blind and cannot choose the suitable lines of
development and cause the movement of Prakṛti along them
for its fullest realisation. Prakṛti itself, though a substantial
entity, is also essentially of the nature of conserved energy
existing in the potential form but always ready to flow out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>and actualise itself, if only its own immanent obstructions are
removed. Its teleological purpose is powerless to remove its
own obstruction. God by His very presence removes the
obstacles, by which, prakṛti of itself moves in the evolutionary
process, and thus the purpose is realised; for the removal of
obstacles by the influence of God takes place in such a way
that the purpose may realise its fullest scope. Realisation of
the teleology means that the interests of purusha are seemingly
affected and purusha appears to see and feel in a manifold way,
and after a long series of such experiences it comes to understand
itself in its own nature, and this being the last and final
realisation of the purpose of prakṛti with reference to that
purusha all connections of prakṛti with such a purusha at once
cease; the purusha is then said to be liberated and the world
ceases for him to exist, though it exists for the other unliberated
purushas, the purpose of the prakṛti with reference to
whom has not been realised. So the world is both eternal and
non-eternal, i.e. its eternality is only relative and not absolute.
Thus the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> says the question “whether the world will
have an end or not cannot be directly answered. The world-process
gradually ceases for the wise and not for others, so no
one-sided decision can be true” (IV. 33).</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BOOK II. ETHICS AND PRACTICE</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c012'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c013'>MIND AND MORAL STATES</span></h3>

<p class='c006'>The Yoga philosophy has essentially a practical tone and its
object consists mainly in demonstrating the means of attaining
salvation, oneness, the liberation of the purusha. The
metaphysical theory which we have discussed at some length,
though it is the basis which justifies its ethical goal, is not
itself the principal subject of Yoga discussion, and is only
dealt with to the extent that it can aid in demonstrating
the ethical view. We must now direct our attention to these
ethical theories. Citta or mind always exists in the form of
its states which are called vṛttis.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> These comprehend all the
manifold states of consciousness of our phenomenal existence.
We cannot distinguish states of consciousness from consciousness
itself, for the consciousness is not something separate
from its states; it exists in them, passes away with their
passing and submerges when they are submerged. It differs
from the senses in this, that they represent the functions and
faculties, whereas citta stands as the entity containing the
conscious states with which we are directly concerned. But
the citta which we have thus described as existing only in its
states is called the kāryyacitta or citta as effect as distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>from the kāraṇacitta or citta as cause. These
kāraṇacittas or cittas as cause are all-pervading like the
ākāśa and are infinite in number, each being connected with
each of the numberless purushas or souls (<cite>Chāyāvyākhyā</cite>,
IV. 10). The reason assigned for acknowledging such a
kāraṇacitta which must be all-pervading, as is evident from
the quotation, is that the Yogin may have knowledge of all
things at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vācaspati says that this citta being essentially of the
nature of ahaṃkāra is as all-pervading as the ego itself
(IV. 10).</p>

<p class='c007'>This kāraṇacitta contracts or expands and appears as our
individual cittas in our various bodies at successive rebirths.
The kāraṇacitta is always connected with the purusha and
appears contracted when the purusha presides over animal
bodies, and as relatively expanded when he presides over
human bodies, and more expanded when he presides over the
bodies of gods, etc. This contracted or expanded citta appears
as our kāryyacitta which always manifests itself as our states
of consciousness. After death the kāraṇacitta, which is always
connected with the purusha, manifests itself in the new body
which is formed by the āpūra (filling in of prakṛti on account
of effective merit or demerit that the purusha had apparently
acquired). The formation of the body as well as the contraction
or expansion of the kāraṇacitta as the corresponding
kāryyacitta to suit it is due to this āpūra. The Yoga does
not hold that the citta has got a separate fine astral body
within which it may remain encased and be transferred along
with it to another body on rebirth. The citta being all-pervading,
it appears both to contract or expand to suit
the particular body destined for it owing to its merit or demerit,
but there is no separate astral body (<cite>Tattvavaiśāradī</cite>,
IV. 10). In reality the karaṇacitta as such always remains
vibhu or all-pervading; it is only its kāryyacitta or vṛtti
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>that appears in a contracted or expanded form, according
to the particular body which it may be said to occupy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sāṃkhya view, however, does not regard the citta
to be essentially all-pervading, but small or great according
as the body it has to occupy. Thus Bhikshu and Nāgeśa in
explaining the <cite>Bhāshya</cite>, “others think that the citta expands
or contracts according as it is in a bigger or smaller body,
just as light rays do according as they are placed in the jug
or in a room,” attributes this view to the Sāṃkhya (<cite>Vyāsabhāshya</cite>,
IV. 10, and the commentaries by Bhikshu and Nāgeśa
on it).<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is this citta which appears as the particular states of
consciousness in which both the knower and the known are
reflected, and it comprehends them both in one state of consciousness.
It must, however, be remembered that this citta
is essentially a modification of prakṛti, and as such is non-intelligent;
but by the seeming reflection of the purusha it
appears as the knower knowing a certain object, and we
therefore see that in the states themselves are comprehended
both the knower and the known. This citta is not, however,
a separate tattva, but is the sum or unity of the eleven senses
and the ego and also of the five prāṇas or biomotor forces
(<cite>Nāgeśa</cite>, IV. 10). It thus stands for all that is psychical in
man: his states of consciousness including the living principle
in man represented by the activity of the five prāṇas.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the object of Yoga gradually to restrain the citta
from its various states and thus cause it to turn back to its
original cause, the kāraṇacitta, which is all-pervading. The
modifications of the kāraṇacitta into such states as the kāryyacitta
is due to its being overcome by its inherent tamas
and rajas; so when the transformations of the citta into the
passing states are arrested by concentration, there takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>place a backward movement and the all-pervading state of
the citta being restored to itself and all tamas being overcome,
the Yogin acquires omniscience, and finally when this citta
becomes as pure as the form of purusha itself, the purusha
becomes conscious of himself and is liberated from the bonds
of prakṛti.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Yoga philosophy in the first chapter describes the Yoga
for him whose mind is inclined towards trance-cognition. In
the second chapter is described the means by which one with
an ordinary worldly mind (<i>vyutthāna citta</i>) may also acquire
Yoga. In the third chapter are described those phenomena
which strengthen the faith of the Yogin on the means of
attaining Yoga described in the second chapter. In the fourth
chapter is described kaivalya, absolute independence or
oneness, which is the end of all the Yoga practices.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Bhāshya</cite> describes the five classes of cittas and comments
upon their fitness for the Yoga leading to kaivalya.
Those are I. <i>kshipta</i> (wandering), II. <i>mūḍha</i> (forgetful), III.
<i>vikshipta</i> (occasionally steady), IV. <i>ekāgra</i> (one-pointed),
<i>niruddha</i> (restrained).</p>

<p class='c007'>I. The <i>kshiptacitta</i> is characterised as wandering, because
it is being always moved by the rajas. This is that citta
which is always moved to and fro by the rise of passions,
the excess of which may indeed for the time overpower the
mind and thus generate a temporary concentration, but it
has nothing to do with the contemplative concentration
required for attaining absolute independence. The man
moved by rajas, far from attaining any mastery of himself,
is rather a slave to his own passions and is always being
moved to and fro and shaken by them (see <cite>Siddhānta-candrikā</cite>,
I. 2, <cite>Bhojavṛtti</cite>, I. 2).</p>

<p class='c007'>II. The mūḍhacitta is that which is overpowered by
tamas, or passions, like that of anger, etc., by which it loses
its senses and always chooses the wrong course. Svāmin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Hariharāraṇya suggests a beautiful example of such concentration
as similar to that of certain snakes which become
completely absorbed in the prey upon which they are about
to pounce.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. The vikshiptacitta, or distracted or occasionally
steady citta, is that mind which rationally avoids the painful
actions and chooses the pleasurable ones. Now none of these
three kinds of mind can hope to attain that contemplative
concentration called Yoga. This last type of mind represents
ordinary people, who sometimes tend towards good but
relapse back to evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. The one-pointed (ekāgra) is that kind of mind in which
true knowledge of the nature of reality is present and the
afflictions due to nescience or false knowledge are thus attenuated
and the mind better adapted to attain the nirodha
or restrained state. All these come under the saṃprajñāta
(concentration on an object of knowledge) type.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. The nirodha or restrained mind is that in which all
mental states are arrested. This leads to kaivalya.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ordinarily our minds are engaged only in perception,
inference, etc.—those mental states which we all naturally
possess. These ordinary mental states are full of rajas and
tamas. When these are arrested, the mind flows with an
abundance of sattva in the saṃprajñāta samādhi; lastly
when even the saṃprajñāta state is arrested, all possible
states become arrested.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important fact which must be noted is the relation
of the actual states of mind called the vṛttis with the latent
states called the saṃskāras—the potency. When a particular
mental state passes away into another, it is not altogether
lost, but is preserved in the mind in a latent form as a saṃskāra,
which is always trying to manifest itself in actuality.
The vṛttis or actual states are thus both generating the
saṃskāras and are also always tending to manifest themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and actually generating similar vṛttis or actual states.
There is a circulation from vṛttis to saṃskāras and from them
again to vṛttis (<i>saṃskārāḥ vṛttibhiḥ kriyante, saṃskāraiśca
vṛttayaḥ evaṃ vṛttisaṃskāracakramaniśamāvarttate</i>). So the
formation of saṃskāras and their conservation are gradually
being strengthened by the habit of similar vṛttis or actual
states, and their continuity is again guaranteed by the strength
and continuity of these saṃskāras. The saṃskāras are like
roots striking deep into the soil and growing with the growth
of the plant above, but even when the plant above the soil
is destroyed, the roots remain undisturbed and may again
shoot forth as plants whenever they obtain a favourable
season. Thus it is not enough for a Yogin to arrest any
particular class of mental states; he must attain such a habit
of restraint that the saṃskāra thus generated is able to overcome,
weaken and destroy the saṃskāra of those actual states
which he has arrested by his contemplation. Unless restrained
by such a habit, the saṃskāra of cessation (<i>nirodhaja saṃskāra</i>)
which is opposed to the previously acquired mental
states become powerful and destroy the latter, these are
sure to shoot forth again in favourable season into their
corresponding actual states.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conception of avidyā or nescience is here not negative
but has a definite positive aspect. It means that kind of
knowledge which is opposed to true knowledge (<i>vidyāviparītaṃ
jñānāntaramavidyā</i>). This is of four kinds: (1) The thinking
of the non-eternal world, which is merely an effect, as eternal.
(2) The thinking of the impure as the pure, as for example
the attraction that a woman’s body may have for a man
leading him to think the impure body pure. (3) The thinking
of vice as virtue, of the undesirable as the desirable, of pain
as pleasure. We know that for a Yogin every phenomenal
state of existence is painful (II. 15). A Yogin knows that
attachment (<i>rāga</i>) to sensual and other objects can only give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>temporary pleasure, for it is sure to be soon turned into pain.
Enjoyment can never bring satisfaction, but only involves a
man further and further in sorrows. (4) Considering the non-self,
e.g. the body as the self. This causes a feeling of being
injured on the injury of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the moment of enjoyment there is always present
suffering from pain in the form of aversion to pain; for the
tendency to aversion from pain can only result from the
incipient memory of previous sufferings. Of course this is
also a case of pleasure turned into pain (<i>pariṇāmaduḥkhatā</i>),
but it differs from it in this that in the case of pariṇāmaduḥkha
pleasure is turned into pain as a result of change or pariṇāma
in the future, whereas in this case the anxiety as to pain is
a thing of the present, happening at one and the same time
that a man is enjoying pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Enjoyment of pleasure or suffering from pain causes those
impressions called saṃskāra or potencies, and these again
when aided by association naturally create their memory and
thence comes attachment or aversion, then again action, and
again pleasure and pain and hence impressions, memory,
attachment or aversion, and again action and so forth.</p>

<p class='c007'>All states are modifications of the three guṇas; in each one
of them the functions of all the three guṇas are seen, contrary
to one another. These contraries are observable in their
developed forms, for the guṇas are seen to abide in various
proportions and compose all our mental states. Thus a Yogin
who wishes to be released from pain once for all is very sensitive
and anxious to avoid even our so-called pleasures. The
wise are like the eye-ball. As a thread of wool thrown into
the eye pains by merely touching it, but not when it comes
into contact with any other organ, so the Yogin is as
tender as the eye-ball, when others are insensible of pain.
Ordinary persons, however, who have again and again suffered
pains as the consequence of their own karma, and who again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>seek them after having given them up, are all round
pierced through as it were by nescience, their minds become
full of afflictions, variegated by the eternal residua of the
passions. They follow in the wake of the “I” and the
“Mine” in relation to things that should be left apart,
pursuing threefold pain in repeated births, due to external
and internal causes. The Yogin seeing himself and
the world of living beings surrounded by the eternal flow
of pain, turns for refuge to right knowledge, cause of the
destruction of all pains (<cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, II. 15).</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking of the mind and body and the objects of the
external world as the true self and feeling affected by their
change is avidyā (false knowledge).</p>

<p class='c007'>The modifications that this avidyā suffers may be summarised
under four heads.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. The ego, which, as described above, springs from the
identification of the buddhi with the purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. From this ego springs attachment (<i>rāga</i>) which is
the inclination towards pleasure and consequently towards
the means necessary for attaining it in a person who has
previously experienced pleasures and remembers them.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. Repulsion from pain also springs from the ego and is
of the nature of anxiety for its removal; anger at pain and
the means which produces pain, remains in the mind in consequence
of the feeling of pain, in the case of him who has felt
and remembers pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. Love of life also springs from the ego. This feeling
exists in all persons and appears in a positive aspect in the
form “would that I were never to cease.” This is due to the
painful experience of death in some previous existence, which
abides in us as a residual potency (<i>vāsanā</i>) and causes the
instincts of self-preservation, fear of death and love of life.
These modifications including avidyā are called the five
kleśas or afflictions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>We are now in a position to see the far-reaching effects of
the identification of the purusha with the buddhi. We have
already seen how it has generated the macrocosm or external
world on the one hand, and manas and the senses on the other.
Now we see that from it also spring attachment to pleasure,
aversion from pain and love of life, motives observable in
most of our states of consciousness, which are therefore called
the <i>klishṭa vṛtti</i> or afflicted states. The five afflictions (false
knowledge and its four modifications spoken above) just
mentioned are all comprehended in avidyā, since avidyā or
false knowledge is at the root of all worldly experiences. The
sphere of avidyā is all false knowledge generally, and that of
asmitā is also inseparably connected with all our experiences
which consist in the identification of the intelligent self with
the sensual objects of the world, the attainment of which seems
to please us and the loss of which is so painful to us. It must,
however, be remembered that these five afflictions are only
different aspects of avidyā and cannot be conceived separately
from avidyā. These always lead us into the meshes of the
world, far from our final goal—the realisation of our own
self—emancipation of the purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opposed to it are the vṛttis or states which are called
unafflicted, aklishṭa, the habit of steadiness (<i>abhyāsa</i>) and
non-attachment to pleasures (<i>vairāgya</i>) which being antagonistic
to the afflicted states, are helpful towards achieving true
knowledge. These represent such thoughts as tend towards
emancipation and are produced from our attempts to conceive
rationally our final state of emancipation, or to adopt suitable
means for this. They must not, however, be confused with
puṇyakarma (virtuous action), for both puṇya and pāpa
karma are said to have sprung from the kleśas. There is no
hard and fast rule with regard to the appearance of these
klishṭa and aklishṭa states, so that in the stream of the klishṭa
states or in the intervals thereof, aklishṭa states may also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>appear—as practice and desirelessness born from the study
of the Veda-reasoning and precepts—and remain quite distinct
in itself, unmixed with the klishṭa states. A Brahman being
in a village which is full of the Kirātas, does not himself
become a Kirāta (a forest tribe) for that reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each aklishṭa state produces its own potency or saṃskāra,
and with the frequency of the states their saṃskāra is
strengthened which in due course suppresses the aklishṭa
states.</p>

<p class='c007'>These klishṭa and aklishṭa modifications are of five descriptions:
pramāṇa (real cognition), viparyyaya (unreal cognition),
vikalpa (logical abstraction and imagination), nidrā
(sleep), smṛti (memory). These vṛttis or states, however, must
be distinguished from the six kinds of mental activity mentioned
in <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, II. 18: grahaṇa (reception or
presentative ideation), dhāraṇa (retention), ūha (assimilation),
apoha (differentiation), tattvajñāna (right knowledge), abhiniveśa
(decision and determination), of which these states
are the products.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen that from avidyā spring all the kleśas or
afflictions, which are therefore seen to be the source of the
klishṭa vṛttis as well. Abhyāsa and vairāgya—the aklishṭa
vṛttis, which spring from precepts, etc., lead to right knowledge,
and as such are antagonistic to the modification of the
guṇas on the avidyā side.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know also that both these sets of vṛttis—the klishṭa
and the aklishṭa—produce their own kinds of saṃskāras, the
klishṭa saṃskāra and the aklishṭa or prajñā saṃskāra. All
these modifications of citta as vṛtti and saṃskāra are the
dharmas of citta, considered as the dharmin or substance.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c013'>THE THEORY OF KARMA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The vṛttis are called the mānasa karmas (mental work) as
different from the bāhya karmas (external work) achieved in
the exterior world by the five motor or active senses. These
may be divided into four classes: (1) kṛshṇa (black), (2)
śukla (white), (3) śuklakṛshṇa (white and black), (4) aśuklākṛshṇa
(neither white nor black). (1) The kṛshṇa karmas
are those committed by the wicked and, as such, are wicked
actions called also adharma (demerit). These are of two
kinds, viz. bāhya and mānasa, the former being of the nature
of speaking ill of others, stealing others’ property, etc., and the
latter of the nature of such states as are opposed to śraddhā,
vīrya, etc., which are called the śukla karma. (2) The śukla
karmas are virtuous or meritorious deeds. These can only
occur in the form of mental states, and as such can take place
only in the mānasa karma. These are śraddhā (faith), vīrya
(strength), smṛti (meditation), samādhi (absorption), and
prajñā (wisdom), which are infinitely superior to actions
achieved in the external world by the motor or active senses.
The śukla karma belongs to those who resort to study and
meditation. (3) The śuklakṛshṇa karma are the actions
achieved in the external world by the motor or active senses.
These are called white and black, because actions achieved in
the external world, however good (śukla) they might be,
cannot be altogether devoid of wickedness (kṛshṇa), since
all external actions entail some harm to other living beings.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Even the Vedic duties, though meritorious, are associated
with sins, for they entail the sacrificing of animals.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The white side of these actions, viz.: that of helping others
and doing good is therefore called dharma, as it is the cause
of the enjoyment of pleasure and happiness for the doer. The
kṛshṇa or black side of these actions, viz. that of doing
injury to others is called adharma, as it is the cause of the
suffering of pain to the doer. In all our ordinary states
of existence we are always under the influence of dharma
and adharma, which are therefore called vehicles of actions
(<i>āśerate sāṃsārikā purushā asmin niti āśayaḥ</i>). That in which
some thing lives is its vehicle. Here the purushas in evolution
are to be understood as living in the sheath of actions (which
is for that reason called a vehicle or āśaya). Merit or virtue, and
sin or demerit are the vehicles of actions. All śukla karma,
therefore, either mental or external, is called merit or virtue
and is productive of happiness; all kṛshṇa karma, either
mental or external, is called demerit, sin or vice and is
productive of pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) The karma called aśuklakṛshṇa (neither black nor
white) is of those who have renounced everything, whose
afflictions have been destroyed and whose present body is the
last one they will have. Those who have renounced actions,
the karma-sannyāsis (and not those who belong to the
sannyāsāśrama merely), are nowhere found performing
actions which depend upon external means. They have
not got the black vehicle of actions, because they do not
perform such actions. Nor do they possess the white
vehicle of actions, because they dedicate to Īśvara the fruits
of all vehicles of action, brought about by the practice of
Yoga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to the question of karmāśaya again for review,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>we see that being produced from desire (<i>kāma</i>), avarice (<i>lobha</i>),
ignorance (<i>moha</i>), and anger (<i>krodha</i>) it has really got at its root
the kleśas (afflictions) such as avidyā (ignorance), asmitā
(egoism), rāga (attachment), dvesha (antipathy), abhiniveśa
(love of life). It will be easily seen that the passions named
above, desire, lust, etc., are not in any way different from the
kleśas or afflictions previously mentioned; and as all actions,
virtuous or sinful, have their springs in the said sentiments of
desire, anger, covetousness, and infatuation, it is quite enough
that all these virtuous or sinful actions spring from
the kleśas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now this karmāśaya ripens into life-state, life-experience
and life-time, if the roots—the afflictions—exist. Not only is
it true that when the afflictions are rooted out, no karmāśaya
can accumulate, but even when many karmāśayas of many
lives are accumulated, they are rooted out when the afflictions
are destroyed. Otherwise, it is difficult to conceive that the
karmāśaya accumulated for an infinite number of years,
whose time of ripeness is uncertain, will be rooted out! So
even if there be no fresh karmāśaya after the rise of true
knowledge, the purusha cannot be liberated but will be
required to suffer an endless cycle of births and rebirths to
exhaust the already accumulated karmāśayas of endless lives.
For this reason, the mental plane becomes a field for the
production of the fruits of action only, when it is watered by
the stream of afflictions. Hence the afflictions help the
vehicle of actions (karmāśaya) in the production of their
fruits also. It is for this reason that when the afflictions are
destroyed the power which helps to bring about the manifestation
also disappears; and on that account the vehicles of
actions although existing in innumerable quantities have no
time for their fruition and do not possess the power of producing
fruit, because their seed-powers are destroyed by intellection.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Karmāśaya is of two kinds. (1) Ripening in the same life
<i>dṛshṭajanmavedanīya</i>. (2) Ripening in another unknown
life. That puṇya karmāśaya, which is generated by intense
purificatory action, trance and repetition of mantras, and
that pāpa karmāśaya, which is generated by repeated evil done
either to men who are suffering the extreme misery of fear,
disease and helplessness, or to those who place confidence in
them or to those who are high-minded and perform tapas,
ripen into fruit in the very same life, whereas other kinds of
karmāśayas ripen in some unknown life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Living beings in hell have no dṛshṭajanma karmāśaya, for
this life is intended for suffering only and their bodies are
called the bhoga-śarīras intended for suffering alone and not
for the accumulation of any karmāśaya which could take effect
in that very life.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are others whose afflictions have been spent and
exhausted and thus they have no such karmāśaya, the effect of
which they will have to reap in some other life. They are thus
said to have no adṛshṭa-janmavedanīya karma.</p>

<p class='c007'>The karmāśaya of both kinds described above ripens into
life-state, life-time and life-experience. These are called the
three ripenings or vipākas of the karmāśaya; and they are
conducive to pleasure or pain, according as they are products of
puṇyakarmāśaya (virtue) or pāpa karmāśaya (vice or demerit).
Many karmāśayas combine to produce one life-state; for
it is not possible that each karma should produce one or
many life-states, for then there would be no possibility of
experiencing the effects of the karmas, because if for each one
of the karmas we had one or more lives, karmas, being endless,
space for obtaining lives in which to experience effects would
not be available, for it would take endless time to exhaust the
karmas already accumulated. It is therefore held that many
karmas unite to produce one life-state or birth (jāti) and to
determine also its particular duration (āyush) and experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>(bhoga). The virtuous and sinful karmāśayas accumulated in
one life, in order to produce their effects, cause the death of the
individual and manifest themselves in producing his rebirth,
his duration of life and particular experiences, pleasurable or
painful. The order of undergoing the experiences is the order
in which the karmas manifest themselves as effects, the
principal ones being manifested earlier in life. The principal
karmas here refer to those which are quite ready to generate
their effects. Thus it is said that those karmas which produce
their effects immediately are called primary, whereas those
which produce effects after some delay are called secondary.
Thus we see that there is continuity of existence throughout;
when the karmas of this life ripen jointly they tend to fructify
by causing another birth as a means to which death is caused,
and along with it life is manifested in another body (according
to the dharma and adharma of the karmāśaya) formed by
the prakṛtyāpūra (cf. the citta theory described above); and
the same karmāśaya regulates the life-period and experiences
of that life, the karmāśayas of which again take a similar course
and manifest themselves in the production of another life and
so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen that the karmāśaya has three fructifications,
viz. jāti, āyush and bhoga. Now generally the karmāśaya
is regarded as ekabhavika or unigenital, i.e. it accumulates in
one life. Ekabhava means one life and ekabhavika means the
product of one life, or accumulated in one life. Regarded
from this point of view, it may be contrasted with the vāsanās
which remain accumulated from thousands of previous lives
since eternity, the mind, being pervaded all over with them,
as a fishing-net is covered all over with knots. This vāsanā
results from memory of the experiences of a life generated by
the fructification of the karmāśaya and kept in the citta in the
form of potency or impressions (saṃskāra). Now we have
previously seen that the citta remains constant in all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>births and rebirths that an individual has undergone from
eternity; it therefore keeps the memory of those various
experiences of thousands of lives in the form of saṃskāra or
potency and is therefore compared with a fishing-net pervaded
all over with knots. The vāsanās therefore are not the results
of the accumulation of experiences or their memory in one life
but in many lives, and are therefore called anekabhavika as
contrasted with the karmāśaya representing virtuous and
vicious actions which are accumulated in one life and which
produce another life, its experiences and its life-duration as a
result of fructification (vipāka). This vāsanā is the cause of
the instinctive tendencies, or habits of deriving pleasures and
pains peculiar to different animal lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the habits of a dog-life and its peculiar modes of
taking its experiences and of deriving pleasures and pains are
very different in nature from those of a man-life; they must
therefore be explained on the basis of an incipient memory in
the form of potency, or impressions (saṃskāra) of the experiences
that an individual must have undergone in a previous
dog-life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now when by the fructification of the karmāśaya a dog-life
is settled for a person, his corresponding vāsanās of a
previous dog-life are at once revived and he begins to take
interest in his dog-life in the manner of a dog; the same
principle applies to the virtue of individuals as men or as
gods (IV. 8).</p>

<p class='c007'>If there was not this law of vāsanās, then any vāsanā would
be revived in any life, and with the manifestation of the
vāsanā of animal life a man would take interest in eating
grass and derive pleasure from it. Thus Nāgeśa says: “Now
if those karmas which produce a man-life should manifest the
vāsanās of animal lives, then one might be inclined to eat
grass as a man, and it is therefore said that only the vāsanās
corresponding to the karmas are revived.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Now as the vāsanās are of the nature of saṃskāras or
impressions, they lie ingrained in the citta and nothing can
prevent their being revived. The intervention of other births
has no effect. For this reason, the vāsanās of a dog-life are at
once revived in another dog-life, though between the first dog-life
and the second dog-life, the individual may have passed
through many other lives, as a man, a bull, etc., though
the second dog-life may take place many hundreds of years
after the first dog-life and in quite different countries. The
difference between saṃskāras, impressions, and smṛti or
memory is simply this that the former is the latent state
whereas the latter is the manifested state; so we see that the
memory and the impressions are identical in nature, so that
whenever a saṃskāra is revived, it means nothing but the
manifestation of the memory of the same experiences conserved
in the saṃskāra in a latent state. Experiences, when
they take place, keep their impressions in the mind, though
thousands of other experiences, lapse of time, etc., may
intervene. They are revived in one moment with the proper
cause of their revival, and the other intervening experiences can
in no way hinder this revival. So it is with the vāsanās,
which are revived at once according to the particular fructification
of the karmāśaya, in the form of a particular life, as a man,
a dog, or anything else.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is now clear that the karmāśaya tending towards fructification
is the cause of the manifestation of the vāsanās already
existing in the mind in a latent form. Thus the Sūtra says:—“When
two similar lives are separated by many births, long
lapses of time and remoteness of space, even then for the
purpose of the revival of the vāsanās, they may be regarded as
immediately following each other, for the memories and
impressions are the same” (<cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite>, IV. 9). The <cite>Bhāshya</cite>
says: “the vāsanā is like the memory (smṛti), and so there
can be memory from the impressions of past lives separated by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>many lives and by remote tracts of country. From these
memories the impressions (saṃskāras) are derived, and the
memories are revived by manifestation of the karmāśayas, and
though memories from past impressions may have many lives
intervening, these interventions do not destroy the causal
antecedence of those past lives” (IV. 9).</p>

<p class='c007'>These vāsanās are, however, beginningless, for a baby just
after birth is seen to feel the fear of death instinctively, and
it could not have derived it from its experience in this
life. Again, if a small baby is thrown upwards, it is seen
to shake and cry like a grown-up man, and from this it may
be inferred that it is afraid of falling down on the ground and
is therefore shaking through fear. Now this baby has never
learnt in this life from experience that a fall on the ground will
cause pain, for it has never fallen on the ground and suffered
pain therefrom; so the cause of this fear cannot be sought
in the experiences of this life, but in the memory of past
experiences of fall and pain arising therefrom, which is
innate in this life as vāsanā and causes this instinctive
fear. So this innate memory which causes instinctive fear
of death from the very time of birth, has not its origin in
this life but is the memory of the experience of some
previous life, and in that life, too, it existed as innate
memory of some other previous life, and in that again as
the innate memory of some other life and so on to beginningless
time. This goes to show that the vāsanās are without
beginning.</p>

<p class='c007'>We come now to the question of unigenitality—ekabhavikatva—of
the karmāśaya and its exceptions. We find that
great confusion has occurred among the commentators about
the following passage in the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> which refers to this
subject: The <cite>Bhāshya</cite> according to Vācaspati in II. 13 reads:
<i>tatra dṛshṭajanmavedanīyasya niyatavipākasya</i>, etc. Here
Bhikshu and Nāgeśa read <i>tatrādṛshṭajanmavedanīyasya
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>niyatavipākasya</i>, etc. There is thus a divergence of meaning
on this point between <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite> and his follower Nāgeśa,
on one side, and Vācaspati on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vācaspati says that the dṛshṭajanmavedanīya (to be
fructified in the same visible life) karma is the only true karma
where the karmāśaya is ekabhavika, unigenital, for here these
effects are positively not due to the karma of any other
previous lives, but to the karma of that very life. Thus these
are the only true causes of ekabhavika karmāśaya.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus according to Vācaspati we see that the adṛshṭajanmavedanīya
karma (to be fructified in another life) of unappointed
fruition is never an ideal of ekabhavikatva or unigenital
character; for it may have three different courses: (1) It may
be destroyed without fruition. (2) It may become merged in
the ruling action. (3) It may exist for a long time overpowered
by the ruling action whose fruition has been
appointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vijñāna Bhikshu and his follower Nāgeśa, however, say that
the dṛshṭajanmavedanīya karma (to be fructified in the same
visible life) can never be ekabhavika or unigenital for there
is no bhava, or previous birth there, whose product is being
fructified in that life, for this karma is of that same visible life
and not of some other previous bhava or life; and they agree
in holding that it is for that reason that the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> makes no
mention of this dṛshṭajanmavedanīya karma; it is clear that
the karmāśaya in no other bhava is being fructified here.
Thus we see that about dṛshṭajanmavedanīya karma,
Vācaspati holds that it is the typical case of ekabhavika karma
(karma of the same birth), whereas Vijñāna Bhikshu holds
just the opposite view, viz. that the dṛhṭajanmavedanīya
karma should by no means be considered as ekabhavika since
there is here no bhava or birth, it being fructified in the same
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The adṛshṭajanmavedanīya karma (works to be fructified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>in another life) of unfixed fruition has three different courses:
(I) As we have observed before, by the rise of <i>aśuklākṛshṇa</i>
(neither black nor white) karma, the other karmas—<i>śukla</i>
(black), <i>kṛshṇa</i> (white) and <i>śuklakṛshṇa</i> (both black and
white)—are rooted out. The śukla karmāśaya again arising
from study and asceticism destroys the kṛshṇa karmas without
their being able to generate their effects. These therefore can
never be styled ekabhavika, since they are destroyed without
producing any effect. (II) When the effects of minor actions
are merged in the effects of the major and ruling action. The
sins originating from the sacrifice of animals at a holy sacrifice
are sure to produce bad effects, though they may be minor and
small in comparison with the good effects arising from the
performance of the sacrifice in which they are merged. Thus
it is said that the experts being immersed in floods of happiness
brought about by their sacrifices bear gladly particles of the
fire of sorrow brought about by the sin of killing animals at
sacrifice. So we see that here also the minor actions having
been performed with the major do not produce their effects
independently, and so all their effects are not fully manifested,
and hence these secondary karmāśayas cannot be regarded as
ekabhavika. (III) Again the adṛshṭajanmavedanīya karma (to
be fructified in another life) of unfixed fruition (<i>aniyata vipāka</i>)
remains overcome for a long time by another adṛshṭajanmavedanīya
karma of fixed fruition. A man may for example
do some good actions and some extremely vicious ones, so that
at the time of death, the karmāśaya of those vicious actions
becoming ripe and fit for appointed fruition, generates an
animal life. His good action, whose benefits are such as may
be reaped only in a man-life, will remain overcome until the
man is born again as a man: so this also cannot be said to be
ekabhavika (to be reaped in one life). We may summarise the
classification of karmas according to Vācaspati in a table as
follows:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
<img src='images/i_112.jpg' alt='Karmāśaya  Ekabhavika Anekabhavika  Niyata Vipāka Aniyatavipāka  Adṛshṭajanmavedanīya Dṛshṭajanmavedanīya Adṛshṭajanmavedanīya  (Destruction) (Merged in the effect of the major action.) (To remain  overcome by  the influence  of some other  action.)' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus the karmāśaya may be viewed from two sides, one
being that of fixed fruition and the other unfixed fruition, and
the other that of dṛshṭajanmavedanīya and adṛshṭajanmavedanīya.
Now the theory is that the niyatavipāka (of fixed
fruition) karmāśaya is always ekabhavika, i.e. it does not
remain separated by other lives, but directly produces its
effects in the succeeding life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ekabhavika means that which is produced from the
accumulation of karmas in one life in the life which succeeds
it. Vācaspati, however, takes it also to mean that action
which attains fruition in the same life in which it is performed,
whereas what Vijñāna Bhikshu understands by ekabhavika
is that action alone which is produced in the life immediately
succeeding the life in which it was accumulated. So according
to Vijñāna Bhikshu, the niyata vipāka (of fixed fruition)
dṛshṭajanmavedanīya (to be fructified in the same life) action
is not ekabhavika, since it has no bhava, i.e. it is not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>production of a preceding life. Neither can it be anekabhavika;
thus this niyatavipākadṛshṭajanmavedanīya action is neither
ekabhavika nor anekbhavika. Whereas Vācaspati is inclined
to call this also ekabhavika. About the niyatavipāka-adṛshṭajanmavedanīya
action being called ekabhavika (unigenital)
there seems to be no dispute. The aniyatavipāka-adṛshṭajanmavedanīya
action cannot be called ekabhavika
as it undergoes three different courses described above.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c013'>THE ETHICAL PROBLEM</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have described avidyā and its special forms as the kleśas,
from which also proceed the actions virtuous and vicious,
which in their turn again produce as a result of their fruition,
birth, life and experiences of pleasure and pain and the
vāsanās or residues of the memory of these experiences.
Again every new life or birth is produced from the fructification
of actions of a previous life; a man is made to perform
actions good or bad by the kleśas which are rooted in him,
and these actions, as a result of their fructification, produce
another life and its experiences, in which life again new
actions are earned by virtue of the kleśas, and thus the cycle
is continued. When there is pralaya or involution of the
cosmical world-process the individual cittas of the separate
purushas return back to the prakṛti and lie within it, together
with their own avidyās, and at the time of each new creation
or evolution these are created anew with such changes as are
due according to their individual avidyās, with which they
had to return back to their original cause, the prakṛti, and
spend an indivisible inseparable existence with it. The
avidyās of some other creation, being merged in the prakṛti
along with the cittas, remain in the prakṛti as vāsanās, and
prakṛti being under the influence of these avidyās as vāsanās
creates as modifications of itself the corresponding minds for
the individual purushas, connected with them before the last
pralaya dissolution. So we see that though the cittas had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>returned to their original causes with their individual nescience
(<i>avidyā</i>), the avidyā was not lost but was revived at the
time of the new creation and created such minds as should
be suitable receptacles for it. These minds (buddhi) are
found to be modified further into their specific cittas or mental
planes by the same avidyā which is manifested in them as
the kleśas, and these again in the karmāśaya, jāti, āyush and
bhoga, and so on; the individual, however, is just in the same
position as he was or would have been before the involution
of pralaya. The avidyās of the cittas which had returned to
the prakṛti at the time of the creation being revived, create
their own buddhis of the previous creation, and by their
connection with the individual purushas are the causes of the
saṃsāra or cosmic evolution—the evolution of the microcosm,
the cittas, and the macrocosm or the exterior world.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this new creation, the creative agencies of God and
avidyā are thus distinguished in that the latter represents
the end or purpose of the prakṛti—the ever-evolving energy
transforming itself into its modifications as the mental and
the material world; whereas the former represents that
intelligent power which abides outside the pale of prakṛti,
but removes obstructions offered by the prakṛti. Though
unintelligent and not knowing how and where to yield so
as to form the actual modifications necessary for the realisation
of the particular and specific objects of the numberless
purushas, these avidyās hold within themselves the serviceability
of the purushas, and are the cause of the connection
of the purusha and the prakṛti, so that when these avidyās are
rooted out it is said that the purushārthatā or serviceability
of the purusha is at an end and the purusha becomes liberated
from the bonds of prakṛti, and this is called the final goal of
the purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ethical problem of the Pātañjala philosophy is the
uprooting of this avidyā by the attainment of true knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of the nature of the purusha, which will be succeeded by the
liberation of the purusha and his absolute freedom or independence—kaivalya—the
last realisation of the purusha—the
ultimate goal of all the movements of the prakṛti.</p>

<p class='c007'>This final uprooting of the avidyā with its vāsanās directly
follows the attainment of true knowledge called prajñā, in
which state the seed of false knowledge is altogether burnt
and cannot be revived again. Before this state, the discriminative
knowledge which arises as the recognition of the distinct
natures of purusha and buddhi remains shaky; but when by
continual practice this discriminative knowledge becomes
strengthened in the mind, its potency gradually grows stronger
and stronger, and roots out the potency of the ordinary states
of mental activity, and thus the seed of false knowledge
becomes burnt up and incapable of fruition, and the impurity
of the energy of rajas being removed, the sattva as the manifesting
entity becomes of the highest purity, and in that state
flows on the stream of the notion of discrimination—the
recognition of the distinct natures of purusha and buddhi—free
from impurity. Thus when the state of buddhi becomes
almost as pure as the purusha itself, all self-enquiry subsides,
the vision of the real form of the purusha arises, and false
knowledge, together with the kleśas and the consequent
fruition of actions, ceases once for all. This is that state of
citta which, far from tending towards the objective world,
tends towards the kaivalya of the purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first stages, when the mind attains discriminative
knowledge, the prajñā is not deeply seated, and occasionally
phenomenal states of consciousness are seen to intervene in
the form of “I am,” “Mine,” “I know,” “I do not know,”
because the old potencies, though becoming weaker and
weaker are not finally destroyed, and consequently occasionally
produce their corresponding conscious manifestation
as states which impede the flow of discriminative knowledge.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>But constant practice in rooting out the potency of
this state destroys the potencies of the outgoing activity,
and finally no intervention occurs in the flow of the
stream of prajñā through the destructive influence of
phenomenal states of consciousness. In this higher state
when the mind is in its natural, passive, and objectless
stream of flowing prajñā, it is called the dharmamegha-saṁādhi.
When nothing is desired even from dhyāna arises
the true knowledge which distinguishes prakṛti from purusha
and is called the dharmamegha-samādhi (<cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite>,
IV. 29). The potency, however, of this state of consciousness
lasts until the purusha is finally liberated from the bonds
of prakṛti and is absolutely free (kevalī). Now this is the
state when the citta becomes infinite, and all its tamas being
finally overcome, it shines forth like the sun, which can reflect
all, and in comparison to which the crippled insignificant light
of objective knowledge shrinks altogether, and thus an
infinitude is acquired, which has absorbed within itself all
finitude, which cannot have any separate existence or manifestation
through this infinite knowledge. All finite states
of knowledge are only a limitation of true infinite knowledge,
in which there is no limitation of this and that. It absorbs
within itself all these limitations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The purusha in this state may be called the emancipated
being, jīvanmukta. Nāgeśa in explaining <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>,
IV. 31, describing the emancipated life says: “In this
jīvanmukta stage, being freed from all impure afflictions and
karmas, the consciousness shines in its infirmity. The
infiniteness of consciousness is different from the infiniteness
of materiality veiled by tamas. In those stages there could
be consciousness only with reference to certain things with
reference to which the veil of tamas was raised by rajas.
When all veils and impurities are removed, then little is left
which is not known. If there were other categories besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the 25 categories, these also would then have been known”
(<cite>Chāyāvyākhyā</cite>, IV. 31).</p>

<p class='c007'>Now with the rise of such dharmamegha the succession
of the changes of the qualities is over, inasmuch as they have
fulfilled their object by having achieved experience and
emancipation, and their succession having ended, they cannot
stay even for a moment. And now comes absolute freedom,
when the guṇas return back to the pradhāna their primal
cause, after performing their service for the purusha by
providing his experience and his salvation, so that they
lose all their hold on purusha and purusha remains as he is
in himself, and never again has any connection with the
buddhi. The purusha remains always in himself in absolute
freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The order of the return of the guṇas for a kevalī purusha is
described below in the words of Vācaspati: The guṇas as
cause and effect involving ordinary experiences samādhi and
nirodha, become submerged in the manas; the manas
becomes submerged in the asmitā, the asmitā in the liṅga,
and the liṅga in the aliṅga.</p>

<p class='c007'>This state of kaivalya must be distinguished from the state
of mahāpralaya in which also the guṇas return back to
prakṛti, for that state is again succeeded by later connections
of prakṛti with purushas through the buddhis, but the state
of kaivalya is an eternal state which is never again disturbed
by any connection with prakṛti, for now the separation of
prakṛti from purusha is eternal, whereas that in the mahāpralaya
state was only temporary.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall conclude this section by noting two kinds of eternity
of purusha and of prakṛti, and by offering a criticism of the
prajñā state. The former is said to be perfectly and unchangeably
eternal (<i>kūṭastha nitya</i>), and the latter is only
eternal in an evolutionary form. The permanent or eternal
reality is that which remains unchanged amid its changing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>appearances; and from this point of view both purusha
and prakṛti are eternal. It is indeed true, as we have seen
just now, that the succession of changes of qualities with
regard to buddhi, etc., comes to an end when kaivalya is
attained, but this is with reference to purusha, for the changes
of qualities in the guṇas themselves never come to an end.
So the guṇas in themselves are eternal in their changing or
evolutionary character, and are therefore said to possess
evolutionary eternity (<i>pariṇāminityatā</i>). Our phenomenal
conception cannot be free from change, and therefore it is
that in our conception of the released purushas we affirm
their existence, as for example when we say that the released
purushas exist eternally. But it must be carefully noted
that this is due to the limited character of our thoughts and
expressions, not to the real nature of the released purushas,
which remain for ever unqualified by any changes or modifications,
pure and colourless as the very self of shining intelligence
(see <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, IV. 33).</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall conclude this section by giving a short analysis
of the prajñā state from its first appearance to the final release
of purusha from the bondage of prakṛti. Patañjali says that
this prajñā state being final in each stage is sevenfold. Of
these the first four stages are due to our conscious endeavour,
and when these conscious states of prajñā (supernatural
wisdom) flow in a stream and are not hindered or interfered
with in any way by other phenomenal conscious states of
pratyayas the purusha becomes finally liberated through the
natural backward movement of the citta to its own primal
cause, and this backward movement is represented by the
other three stages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The seven prajñā stages may be thus enumerated:—</p>

<p class='c007'>I. The pain to be removed is known. Nothing further
remains to be known of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the first aspect of the prajñā, in which the person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>willing to be released knows that he has exhausted all that
is knowable of the pains.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. The cause of the pains has been removed and nothing
further remains to be removed of it. This is the second stage
or aspect of the rise of prajñā.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. The nature of the extinction of pain has already
been perceived by me in the state of samādhi, so that I have
come to learn that the final extinction of my pain will be
something like it.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. The final discrimination of prakṛti and purusha, the
true and immediate means of the extinction of pain, has been
realised.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this stage, nothing remains to be done by the purusha
himself. For this is the attainment of final true knowledge.
It is also called the para vairāgya. It is the highest consummation,
in which the purusha has no further duties to
perform. This is therefore called the kārya vimukti (or
salvation depending on the endeavour of the purusha) or
jīvanmukti.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this follows the citta vimukti or the process of release
of the purusha from the citta, in three stages.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. The aspect of the buddhi, which has finally finished its
services to purusha by providing scope for purusha’s experiences
and release; so that it has nothing else to perform
for purusha. This is the first stage of the retirement of the
citta.</p>

<p class='c007'>VI. As soon as this state is attained, like the falling of
stones thrown from the summit of a hill, the guṇas cannot
remain even for a moment to bind the purusha, but at once
return back to their primal cause, the prakṛti; for the
avidyā being rooted out, there is no tie or bond which can
keep it connected with purusha and make it suffer changes
for the service of purusha. All the purushārthatā being
ended, the guṇas disappear of themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>VII. The seventh and last aspect of the guṇas is that they
never return back to bind purusha again, their teleological
purpose being fulfilled or realised. It is of course easy to
see that, in these last three stages, purusha has nothing to
do; but the guṇas of their own nature suffer these backward
modifications and return back to their own primal cause and
leave the purusha kevalī (for ever solitary). <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>,
II. 15.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vyāsa says that as the science of medicine has four divisions:
(1) disease, (2) the cause of disease, (3) recovery, (4) medicines;
so this Yoga philosophy has also four divisions, viz.: (I)
Saṃsāra (the evolution of the prakṛti in connection with the
purusha). (II) The cause of saṃsāra. (III) Release. (IV)
The means of release.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these the first three have been described at some length
above. We now direct our attention to the fourth. We have
shown above that the ethical goal, the ideal to be realised,
is absolute freedom or kaivalya, and we shall now consider
the line of action that must be adopted to attain this goal—the
<i>summum bonum</i>. All actions which tend towards the
approximate realisation of this goal for man are called kuśala,
and the man who achieves this goal is called kuśalī. It is
in the inherent purpose of prakṛti that man should undergo
pains which include all phenomenal experiences of pleasures
as well, and ultimately adopt such a course of conduct as to
avoid them altogether and finally achieve the true goal, the
realisation of which will extinguish all pains for him for
ever. The motive therefore which prompts a person towards
this ethico-metaphysical goal is the avoidance of pain. An
ordinary man feels pain only in actual pain, but a Yogin who
is as highly sensitive as the eye-ball, feels pain in pleasure
as well, and therefore is determined to avoid all experiences,
painful or so-called pleasurable. The extinguishing of all
experiences, however, is not the true ethical goal, being only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>a means to the realisation of kaivalya or the true self and
nature of the purusha. But this means represents the highest
end of a person, the goal beyond which all his duties cease;
for after this comes kaivalya which naturally manifests itself
on the necessary retirement of the prakṛti. Purusha has
nothing to do in effectuating this state, which comes of itself.
The duties of the purusha cease with the thorough extinguishing
of all his experiences. This therefore is the means of
extinguishing all his pains, which are the highest end of all
his duties; but the complete extinguishing of all pains is
identical with the extinguishing of all experiences, the states
or vṛttis of consciousness, and this again is identical with the
rise of prajñā or true discriminative knowledge of the difference
in nature of prakṛti and its effects from the purusha—the
unchangeable. These three sides are only the three aspects
of the same state which immediately precede kaivalya. The
prajñā aspect is the aspect of the highest knowledge, the
suppression of the states of consciousness or experiences,
and it is the aspect of the cessation of all conscious activity
and of painlessness or the extinguishing of all pains as the
feeling aspect of the same nirvīja—samādhi state. But when
the student directs his attention to this goal in his ordinary
states of experience, he looks at it from the side of the feeling
aspect, viz. that of acquiring a state of painlessness, and as
a means thereto he tries to purify the mind and be moral
in all his actions, and begins to restrain and suppress his
mental states, in order to acquire this nirvīja or seedless state.
This is the sphere of conduct which is called Yogāṅga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course there is a division of duties according to the
advancement of the individual, as we shall have occasion to
show hereafter. This suppression of mental states which
has been described as the means of attaining final release,
the ultimate ethical goal of life, is called Yoga. We have
said before that of the five kinds of mind—kshipta, mūḍha,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>vikshipta, ekāgra, niruddha—only the last two are fit for the
process of Yoga and ultimately acquire absolute freedom.
In the other three, though concentration may occasionally
happen, yet there is no extrication of the mind from the
afflictions of avidyā and consequently there is no final release.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='c013'>YOGA PRACTICE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Yoga which, after weakening the hold of the afflictions
and causing the real truth to dawn upon our mental vision,
gradually leads us towards the attainment of our final goal,
is only possible for the last two kinds of minds and is of two
kinds: (1) samprajñāta (cognitive) and (2) asamprajñāta
(ultra-cognitive). The samprajñāta Yoga is that in which
the mind is concentrated upon some object, external or internal,
in such a way that it does not oscillate or move from
one object to another, but remains fixed and settled in the
object that it holds before itself. At first, the Yogin holds
a gross material object before his view, but when he can make
himself steady in doing this, he tries with the subtle tanmātras,
the five causes of the grosser elements, and when he is successful
in this he takes his internal senses as his object and last
of all, when he has fully succeeded in these attempts, he
takes the great egohood as his object, in which stage his object
gradually loses all its determinate character and he is said
to be in a state of suppression in himself, although devoid of
any object. This state, like the other previous states of the
samprajñāta type, is a positive state of the mind and not a
mere state of vacuity of objects or negativity. In this state,
all determinate character of the states disappears and their
potencies only remain alive. In the first stages of a Yogin
practising samādhi conscious states of the lower stages often
intervene, but gradually, as the mind becomes fixed, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>potencies of the lower stages are overcome by the potencies of
this stage, so that the mind flows in a calm current and at
last the higher prajñā dawns, whereupon the potencies of
this state also are burnt and extinguished, the citta returns
back to its own primal cause, prakṛti, and purusha attains
absolute freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first four stages of the samprajñāta state are called
<i>madhumatī</i>, <i>madhupratīka</i>, <i>viśoka</i> and the <i>saṃskāraśesha</i>
and also <i>vitarkānugata</i>, <i>vicārānugata</i>, <i>ānandānugata</i> and
<i>asmitānugata</i>. True knowledge begins to dawn from the first
stage of this samprajñāta state, and when the Yogin reaches
the last stage the knowledge reaches its culminating point,
but still so long as the potencies of the lower stages of relative
knowledge remain, the knowledge cannot obtain absolute
certainty and permanency, as it will always be threatened
with a possible encroachment by the other states of the past
phenomenal activity now existing as the subconscious.
But the last stage of asamprajñāta samādhi represents the
stage in which the ordinary consciousness has been altogether
surpassed and the mind is in its own true infinite aspect,
and the potencies of the stages in which the mind was full of
finite knowledge are also burnt, so that with the return of
the citta to its primal cause, final emancipation is effected.
The last state of samprajñāta samādhi is called saṃskāraśesha,
only because here the residua of the potencies of subconscious
thought only remain and the actual states of consciousness
become all extinct. It is now easy to see that no mind which
is not in the ekāgra or one-pointed state can be fit for the
asamprajñāta samādhi in which it has to settle itself on one
object and that alone. So also no mind which has not risen
to the state of highest suppression is fit for the asamprajñāta
or nirvīja state.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is now necessary to come down to a lower level and
examine the obstructions, on account of which a mind cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>easily become one-pointed or ekāgra. These, nine in number,
are the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Disease, languor, indecision, want of the mental requirements
necessary for samādhi, idleness of body and mind,
attachment to objects of sense, false and illusory knowledge,
non-attainment of the state of concentrated contemplation,
unsteadiness and unstability of the mind in a samādhi state
even if it can somehow attain it. These are again seen to be
accompanied with pain and despair owing to the non-fulfilment
of desire, physical shakiness or unsteadiness of the limbs,
taking in of breath and giving out of it, which are seen to
follow the nine distractions of a distracted mind described
above.</p>

<p class='c007'>To prevent these distractions and their accompaniments it
is necessary that we should practise concentration on one
truth. Vācaspati says that this one truth on which the mind
should be settled and fixed is Īśvara, and Rāmānanda
Sarasvatī and Nārāyaṇa Tīrtha agree with him. Vijñāna
Bhikshu, however, says that one truth means any object,
gross or fine, and Bhoja supports Vijñāna Bhikshu, staying
that here “one truth” might mean any desirable object.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abhyāsa means the steadiness of the mind in one state
and not complete absence of any state; for the Bhāshyakāra
himself has said in the samāpattisūtra, that samprajñāta
trance comes after this steadiness. As we shall see
later, it means nothing but the application of the five means,
śraddhā, vīrya, smṛti, samādhi and prajñā; it is an endeavour
to settle the mind on one state, and as such does not differ
from the application of the five means of Yoga with a view to
settle and steady the mind (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, I. 13). This effort
becomes firmly rooted, being well attended to for a long time
without interruption and with devotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it does not matter very much whether this one truth is
Īśvara or any other object; for the true principle of Yoga is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the setting of the mind on one truth, principle or object. But
for an ordinary man this is no easy matter; for in order to be
successful the mind must be equipped with śraddhā or faith—the
firm conviction of the Yogin in the course that he adopts.
This keeps the mind steady, pleased, calm and free from
doubts of any kind, so that the Yogin may proceed to the
realisation of his object without any vacillation. Unless a
man has a firm hold on the course that he pursues, all the
steadiness that he may acquire will constantly be threatened
with the danger of a sudden collapse. It will be seen that
vairāgya or desirelessness is only the negative aspect of this
śraddhā. For by it the mind is restrained from the objects of
sense, with an aversion or dislike towards the objects of sensual
pleasure and worldly desires; this aversion towards worldly
joys is only the other aspect of the faith of the mind and the
calmness of its currents (<i>cittaprasāda</i>) towards right knowledge
and absolute freedom. So it is said that the vairāgya
is the effect of śraddhā and its product (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, I. 20).
In order to make a person suitable for Yoga, vairāgya
represents the cessation of the mind from the objects of sense
and their so-called pleasures, and śraddhā means the positive
faith of the mind in the path of Yoga that one adopts, and the
right aspiration towards attaining the highest goal of absolute
freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>In its negative aspect, vairāgya is of two kinds, apara and
para. The apara is that of a mind free from attachment to
worldly enjoyments, such as women, food, drinks and power,
as also from thirst for heavenly pleasures attainable by
practising the vedic rituals and sacrifices. Those who are
actuated by apara vairāgya do not desire to remain in a
bodiless state (<i>videha</i>) merged in the senses or merged in the
prakṛti (<i>prakṛtilīna</i>). It is a state in which the mind is indifferent
to all kinds of pleasures and pains. This vairāgya
may be said to have four stages: (1) Yatamāna—in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>sensual objects are discovered to be defective and the mind
recoils from them. (2) Vyatireka—in which the senses to be
conquered are noted. (3) Ekendriya—in which attachment
towards internal pleasures and aversion towards external
pains, being removed, the mind sets before it the task of
removing attachment and aversion towards mental passions
for obtaining honour or avoiding dishonour, etc. (4) The
fourth and last stage of vairāgya called vaśīkāra is that in
which the mind has perceived the futility of all attractions
towards external objects of sense and towards the pleasures
of heaven, and having suppressed them altogether feels no
attachment, even should it come into connection with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the consummation of this last stage of apara vairāgya,
comes the para vairāgya which is identical with the rise of
the final prajñā leading to absolute independence. This
vairāgya, śraddhā and the abhyāsa represent the unafflicted
states (aklishṭavṛtti) which suppress gradually the klishṭa or
afflicted mental states. These lead the Yogin from one stage
to another, and thus he proceeds higher and higher until the
final state is attained.</p>

<p class='c007'>As vairāgya advances, śraddhā also advances; from
śraddhā comes vīrya, energy, or power of concentration
(<i>dhāraṇā</i>); and from it again springs smṛti—or continuity of
one object of thought; and from it comes samādhi or cognitive
and ultra-cognitive trance; after which follows prajñā,
cognitive and ultra-cognitive trance; after which follows
prajñā and final release. Thus by the inclusion of śraddhā
within vairāgya, its effect, and the other products of śraddhā
with abhyāsa, we see that the abhyāsa and vairāgya are the
two internal means for achieving the final goal of the Yogin,
the supreme suppression and extinction of all states of
consciousness, of all afflictions and the avidyā—the last state
of supreme knowledge or prajñā.</p>

<p class='c007'>As śraddhā, vīrya, smṛti, samādhi which are not different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>from vairāgya and abhyāsa (they being only their other
aspects or simultaneous products), are the means of attaining
Yoga, it is possible to make a classification of the Yogins
according to the strength of these with each, and the strength
of the quickness (<i>saṃvega</i>) with which they may be applied
towards attaining the goal of the Yogin. Thus Yogins are of
nine kinds:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) mildly energetic, (2) of medium energy, (3) of intense
energy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of these may vary in a threefold way according to the
mildness, medium state, or intensity of quickness or readiness
with which the Yogin may apply the means of attaining Yoga.
There are nine kinds of Yogins. Of these the best is he whose
mind is most intensely engaged and whose practice is also the
strongest.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a difference of opinion here about the meaning of
the word saṃvega, between Vācaspati and Vijñāna Bhikshu.
The former says that saṃvega means vairāgya here, but the
latter holds that saṃvega cannot mean vairāgya, and
vairāgya being the effect of śraddhā cannot be taken separately
from it. “Saṃvega” means quickness in the performance
of the means of attaining Yoga; some say that it means
“vairāgya.” But that is not true, for if vairāgya is an effect
of the due performance of the means of Yoga, there cannot be
the separate ninefold classification of Yoga apart from the
various degrees of intensity of the means of Yoga practice.
Further, the word “saṃvega” does not mean “vairāgya”
etymologically (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, I. 20).</p>

<p class='c007'>We have just seen that śraddhā, etc., are the means of
attaining Yoga, but we have not discussed what purificatory
actions an ordinary man must perform in order to attain śraddhā,
from which the other requisites are derived. Of course
these purificatory actions are not the same for all, since they
must necessarily depend upon the conditions of purity or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>impurity of each mind; thus a person already in an advanced
state, may not need to perform those purificatory actions necessary
for a man in a lower state. We have just said that Yogins
are of nine kinds, according to the strength of their mental
acquirements—śraddhā, etc.—the requisite means of Yoga
and the degree of rapidity with which they may be applied.
Neglecting division by strength or quickness of application
along with these mental requirements, we may again divide
Yogins again into three kinds: (1) Those who have the best
mental equipment. (2) Those who are mediocres. (3) Those
who have low mental equipment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first chapter of Yoga aphorisms, it has been stated
that abhyāsa, the application of the mental acquirements of
śraddhā, etc., and vairāgya, the consequent cessation of the
mind from objects of distraction, lead to the extinction of all
our mental states and to final release. When a man is well
developed, he may rest content with his mental actions alone,
in his abhyāsa and vairāgya, in his dhāraṇā (concentration),
dhyāna (meditation), and samādhi (trance), which may be
called the jñānayoga. But it is easy to see that this jñānayoga
requires very high mental powers and thus is not within easy
reach of ordinary persons. Ordinary persons whose minds are
full of impurities, must pass through a certain course of
purificatory actions before they can hope to obtain those
mental acquirements by which they can hope to follow the
course of jñānayoga with facility.</p>

<p class='c007'>These actions, which remove the impurities of the mind,
and thus gradually increase the lustre of knowledge, until the
final state of supreme knowledge is acquired, are called
kriyāyoga. They are also called yogāṅgas, as they help the
maturity of the Yoga process by gradually increasing the
lustre of knowledge. They represent the means by which
even an ordinary mind (<i>vikshiptacitta</i>) may gradually purify
itself and become fit for the highest ideals of Yoga. Thus the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span><cite>Bhāshya</cite> says: “By the sustained practice of these yogāṅgas
or accessories of Yoga is destroyed the fivefold unreal
cognition (<i>avidyā</i>), which is of the nature of impurity.” Destruction
means here disappearance; thus when that is destroyed,
real knowledge is manifested. As the means of achievement
are practised more and more, so is the impurity more and more
attenuated. And as more and more of it is destroyed, so does
the light of wisdom go on increasing more and more. This
process reaches its culmination in discriminative knowledge,
which is knowledge of the nature of purusha and the guṇas.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='c013'>THE YOGĀṄGAS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Now the assertion that these actions are the causes of the
attainment of salvation brings up the question of the exact
natures of their operation with regard to this supreme attainment.
Bhāshyakara says with respect to this that they are the
causes of the separation of the impurities of the mind just as an
axe is the cause of the splitting of a piece of wood; and again
they are the causes of the attainment of the supreme knowledge
just as dhaṛma is the cause of happiness. It must be
remembered that according to the Yoga theory causation is
viewed as mere transformation of energy; the operation of
concomitant causes only removes obstacles impeding the
progress of these transformations in a particular direction; no
cause can of itself produce any effect, and the only way in
which it can help the production of an effect into which the
causal state passes out of its own immanent energy by the
principles of conservation and transformation of energy, is by
removing the intervening obstacles. Thus just as the passage
of citta into a happy state is helped by dharma removing
the intervening obstacles, so also the passage of the citta into
the state of attainment of true knowledge is helped by the
removal of obstructions due to the performance of the
yogāṅgas; the necessary obstructions being removed, the
citta passes naturally of itself into this infinite state of
attainment of true knowledge, in which all finitude is
merged.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>In connection with this, Vyāsa mentions nine kinds of
operation of causes: (1) cause of birth; (2) of preservation;
(3) of manifestation; (4) of modification; (5) knowledge of a
premise leading to a deduction; (6) of otherness; (7) of
separation; (8) of attainment; (9) of upholding (<cite>Vyāsabhāshya</cite>,
II. 28.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of conservation of energy and transformation
of energy being the root idea of causation in this system,
these different aspects represent the different points of view
in which the word causation is generally used.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, the first aspect as the cause of birth or production
is seen when knowledge springs from manas which renders
indefinite cognition definite so that mind is called the cause of
the birth of knowledge. Here mind is the material cause
(<i>upādāna kāraṇa</i>) of the production of knowledge, for knowledge
is nothing but manas with its particular modifications as
states (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, II. 18). The difference of these positive
cause from <i>āptikāraṇa</i>, which operates only in a negative way
and helps production, in an indirect way by the removal of
obstacles, is quite manifest. The <i>sthitikāraṇa</i> or cause
through which things are preserved as they are, is the end
they serve; thus the serviceability of purusha is the cause of
the existence and preservation of the mind as it is, and not
only of mind but of all our phenomenal experiences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third cause of the <i>abhivyaktikāraṇa</i> or manifestation
which is compared to a lamp which manifests things before
our view is an epistemological cause, and as such includes all
sense activity in connection with material objects which
produce cognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then come the fourth and the fifth causes, vikāra (change)
and pratyaya (inseparable connection); thus the cause of
change (<i>vikāra</i>) is exemplified as that which causes a change;
thus the manas suffers a change by the objects presented to it,
just as bile changes and digests the food that is eaten; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>cause of pratyaya<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> is that in which from inseparable connection,
with the knowledge of the premise (e.g. there is smoke in the
hill) we can also have inferential knowledge of the other (e.g.
there is fire in the hill). The sixth cause as otherness (<i>anyatva</i>)
is that which effects changes of form as that brought about by
a goldsmith in gold when he makes a bangle from it, and then
again a necklace, is regarded as differing from the change
spoken of as vikāra. Now the difference between the gold
being turned into bangles or necklaces and the raw rice being
turned into soft rice is this, that in the former case when
bangles are made out of gold, the gold remains the same in
each case, whereas in the case of the production of cooked
rice from raw by fire, the case is different, for heat changes
paddy in a far more definite way; goldsmith and heat
are both indeed efficient causes, but the former only effects
mechanical changes of shape and form, whereas the latter
is the cause of structural and chemical changes. Of course
these are only examples from the physical world, their causal
operations in the mental sphere varying in a corresponding
manner; thus the change produced in the mind by the
presentation of different objects, follows a law which is the
same as is found in the physical world, when the same object
causes different kinds of feelings in different persons; when
ignorance causes forgetfulness in a thing, anger makes it
painful and desire makes it pleasurable, but knowledge of its
true reality produces indifference; there is thus the same kind
of causal change as is found in the external world. Next
for consideration is the cause of separation (<i>viyoga</i>) which is
only a negative aspect of the positive side of the causes of
transformations, as in the gradual extinction of impurities,
consequent upon the transformation of the citta towards the
attainment of the supreme state of absolute independence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>through discriminative knowledge. The last cause for consideration
is that of upholding (<i>dhṛti</i>); thus the body upholds
the senses and supports them for the actualisation of their
activities in the body, just as the five gross elements are the
upholding causes of organic bodies; the bodies of animals,
men, etc., also employ one another for mutual support. Thus
the human body lives by eating the bodies of many animals;
the bodies of tigers, etc., live on the bodies of men and other
animals; many animals live on the bodies of plants, etc.
(<cite>Tattvavaiśāradī</cite>, II. 28). The four kinds of causes mentioned
in Śaṅkara’s works and grammatical commentaries like that
of Susheṇa, viz.: utpādya, vikāryya, āpya and saṃskāryya,
are all included within the nine causes contained mentioned by
Vyāsa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The yogāṅgas not only remove the impurities of the mind
but help it further by removing obstacles in the way of attaining
the highest perfection of discriminative knowledge. Thus
they are the causes in a double sense (1) of the dissociation of
impurities (<i>viyogakāraṇa</i>); (2) of removing obstacles which
impede the course of the mind in attaining the highest development
(<i>āptikāraṇa</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming now to the yogāṅgas, we enumerate them thus:—restraint,
observance, posture, regulation of breath, abstraction,
concentration, meditation and trance: these are the
eight accessories of Yoga.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be remembered that abhyāsa and vairāgya and
also the five means of attaining Yoga, viz.: śraddhā, vīryya,
etc., which are not different from abhyāsa and vairāgya, are
by their very nature included within the yogāṅgas mentioned
above, and are not to be considered as independent means
different from them. The parikarmas or embellishments of
the mind spoken of in the first chapter, with which we shall
deal later on, are also included under the three yogāṅgas
dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samādhi. The five means śraddhā,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>vīryya, smṛti, samādhi and prajñā are said to be included
under asceticism (<i>tapaḥ</i>) studies (<i>svādhyāya</i>) and devotion to
God of the niyamas and vairāgya in contentment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to understand these better, we will first give the
definitions of the yogāṅgas and then discuss them and
ascertain their relative values for a man striving to attain the
highest perfection of Yoga.</p>

<p class='c007'>I. Yama (restraint). These yama restraints are: abstinence
from injury (ahiṃsā); veracity; abstinence from theft;
continence; abstinence from avarice.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. Niyama (observances). These observances are cleanliness,
contentment, purificatory action, study and the making
of God the motive of all action.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. Āsanas (posture). Steady posture and easy position
are regarded as an aid to breath control.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. Regulation of breath (prāṇāyāma) is the stoppage of
the inspiratory and expiratory movements (of breath) which
may be practised when steadiness of posture has been secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. Pratyāhāra (abstraction). With the control of the mind
all the senses become controlled and the senses imitate as it
were the vacant state of the mind. Abstraction is that by
which the senses do not come in contact with their objects
and follow as it were the nature of the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>VI. Dhāraṇā (concentration). Concentration is the steadfastness
of the mind applied to a particular object.</p>

<p class='c007'>VII. Dhyāna (mediation). The continuation there of the
mental effort by continually repeating the object is meditation
(dhyāna).</p>

<p class='c007'>VIII. Samādhi (trance contemplation). The same as above
when shining with the light of the object alone, and devoid as
it were of itself, is trance. In this state the mind becomes one
with its object and there is no difference between the knower
and the known.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the eight yogāṅgas which a Yogin must adopt for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>his higher realisation. Of these again we see that some have
the mental side more predominant, while others are mostly
to be actualised in exterior action. Dhāraṇā, dhyāna and
samādhi, which are purely of the samprajñāta type, and also
the prāṇāyāma and pratyāhāra, which are accessories to them,
serve to cleanse the mind of impurities and make it steady, and
can therefore be assimilated with the parikarmas mentioned
in Book I. Sūtras 34–39. These samādhis of the samprajñāta
type, of course, only serve to steady the mind and to assist
attaining discriminative knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection, it will be well to mention the remaining
aids for cleansing the mind as mentioned in <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite> I.,
viz. the cultivation of the habits of friendliness, compassion,
complacency and indifference towards happiness, misery,
virtue and vice.</p>

<p class='c007'>This means that we are to cultivate the habit of friendliness
towards those who are happy, which will remove all jealous
feelings and purify the mind. We must cultivate the habit
of compassion towards those who are suffering pain; when
the mind shows compassion (which means that it wishes to
remove the miseries of others as if they were his own) it
becomes cleansed of the stain of desire to do injury to
others, for compassion is only another name for sympathy
which naturally identifies the compassionate one with the
objects of his sympathy. Next comes the habit of complacency,
which one should diligently cultivate, for it leads
to pleasure in virtuous deeds. This removes the stain of envy
from the mind. Next comes the habit of indifference, which
we should acquire towards vice in vicious persons. We should
acquire the habit of remaining indifferent where we cannot
sympathise; we should not on any account get angry with
the wicked or with those with whom sympathy is not possible.
This will remove the stain of anger. It will be clearly seen
here that maītrī, karuṇā, muditā and upekshā are only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>different aspects of universal sympathy, which should remove
all perversities in our nature and unite us with our fellow-beings.
This is the positive aspect of the mind with reference
to abstinence from injuring ahiṃsā (mentioned under yamas),
which will cleanse the mind and make it fit for the application
of means of śraddhā, etc. For unless the mind is pure,
there is no scope for the application of the means of making
it steady. These are the mental endeavours to cleanse the
mind and to make it fit for the proper manifestation of
śraddhā, etc., and for steadying it with a view to attaining
true discriminative knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again of the parikarmas by dhāraṇā, dhyāna, and saṃprajñāta
samādhi and the habit of sympathy as manifested
in maitrī, karuṇā, etc., the former is a more advanced
state of the extinction of impurities than the latter.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is easy to see that ordinary minds can never commence
with these practices. They are naturally so impure
that the positive universal sympathy as manifested
in maitrī, etc., by which turbidity of mind is removed,
is too difficult. It is also difficult for them to keep the
mind steady on an object as in dhāraṇā, dhyāna, and
samādhi, for only those in advanced stages can succeed
in this. For ordinary people, therefore, some course of
conduct must be discovered by which they can purify their
minds and elevate them to such an extent that they may be
in a position to avail themselves of the mental parikarmas or
purifications just mentioned. Our minds become steady in
proportion as their impurities are cleansed. The cleansing
of impurities only represents the negative aspect of the
positive side of making the mind steady. The grosser impurities
being removed, finer ones remain, and these are removed
by the mental parikarmas, supplemented by abhyāsa or by
śraddhā, etc. As the impurities are gradually more and more
attenuated, the last germs of impurity are destroyed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>force of dhyāna or the habit of nirodha samādhi, and kaivalya
is attained.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now deal with yamas, by which the gross impurities
of ordinary minds are removed. They are, as we have said
before, non-injury, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and
non-covetousness; of these non-injury is given such a high
place that it is regarded as the root of the other yamas;
truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, non-covetousness and
the other niyamas mentioned previously only serve to make
the non-injury perfect. We have seen before that maitrī,
karuṇa, muditā and upekshā serve to strengthen the non-injury
since they are only its positive aspects, but we see now
that not only they but other yamas and also the other niyamas,
purity, contentment, asceticism, studies and devotion to
God, only serve to make non-injury more and more perfect.
This non-injury when it is performed without being limited
or restricted in any way by caste, country, time and circumstances,
and is always adhered to, is called mahāvrata or
the great duty of abstinence from injury. It is sometimes
limited to castes, as for example injury inflicted by a fisherman,
and in this case it is called anuvrata or restricted ahiṃsā
of ordinary men as opposed to universal ahiṃsā of the Yogins
called mahāvrata; the same non-injury is limited by locality,
as in the case of a man who says to himself, “I shall not
cause injury at a sacred place”; or by time, when a person
says to himself, “I shall not cause injury on the sacred day of
Caturdaśī”; or by circumstances, as when a man says to
himself, “I shall cause injury for the sake of gods and Brahmans
only”; or when injury is caused by warriors in the
battle-field alone and nowhere else. This restricted ahiṃsā
is only for ordinary men who cannot follow the Yogin’s
universal law of ahiṃsā.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ahiṃsā is a great universal duty which a man should
impose on himself in all conditions of life, everywhere, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>at all times without restricting or qualifying it with any
limitation whatsoever. In <cite>Mahābhārata Mokshadharmādhyāya</cite>
it is said that the Sāṃkhya lays stress upon non-injury,
whereas the Yoga lays stress upon samādhi; but
here we see that Yoga also holds that ahiṃsā should be the
greatest ethical motive for all our conduct. It is by ahiṃsā
alone that we can make ourselves fit for the higher type of
samādhi. All other virtues of truthfulness, non-stealing only
serve to make non-injury more and more perfect. It is not,
however, easy to say whether the Sāṃkhyists attached so
much importance to non-injury that they believed it to lead
to samādhi directly without the intermediate stages of
samādhi. We see, however, that the Yoga also attaches great
importance to it and holds that a man should refrain from all
external acts; for however good they may be they cannot
be such as not to lead to some kind of injury or
hiṃsā towards beings, for external actions can never be
performed without doing some harm to others. We have seen
that from this point of view Yoga holds that the only pure
works (śuklakarma) are those mental works of good thoughts
in which perfection of ahiṃsā is attained. With the growth
of good works (śuklakarma) and the perfect realisation of
non-injury the mind naturally passes into the state in which
its actions are neither good (śukla) nor bad (aśukla); and
this state is immediately followed by that of kaivalya.</p>

<p class='c007'>Veracity consists in word and thought being in accordance
with facts. Speech and mind correspond to what has been
seen, heard and inferred. Speech is for the purpose of transferring
knowledge to another. It is always to be employed
for the good of others and not for their injury; for it should
not be defective as in the case of Yudhishṭhira, where his
motive was bad.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> If it prove to be injurious to living beings,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>even though uttered as truth, it is not truth; it is sin only.
Though outwardly such a truthful course may be considered
virtuous, yet since by his truth he has caused injury to another
person, he has in reality violated the true standard of non-injury
(<i>ahiṃsā</i>). Therefore let everyone first examine well and
then utter truth for the benefit of all living beings. All truths
should be tested by the canon of non-injury (<i>ahiṃsā</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Asteya is the virtue of abstaining from stealing. Theft is
making one’s own unlawfully things that belong to others.
Abstinence from theft consists in the absence of the desire
thereof.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brahmacaryya (continence) is the restraint of the generative
organ and the thorough control of sexual tendencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aparigraha is want of avariciousness, the non-appropriation
of things not one’s own; this is attained on seeing the defects
of attachment and of the injury caused by the obtaining,
preservation and destruction of objects of sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, in performing the great duty of non-injury and the other
virtues auxiliary to it, a man be troubled by thoughts of sin,
he should try to remove sinful ideas by habituating himself to
those which are contrary to them. Thus if the old habit of
sins opposed to virtues tend to drive him along the wrong
path, he should in order to banish them entertain ideas such as
the following:—“Being burnt up as I am in the fires of the
world, I have taken refuge in the practice of Yoga which gives
protection to all living beings. Were I to resume the sins
which I have abandoned, I should certainly be behaving like
a dog, which eats its own vomit. As the dog takes up his own
vomit, so should I be acting if I were to take up again what I
have once given up.” This is called the practice of <i>pratipaksha
bhāvān</i>, meditating on the opposites of the temptations.</p>

<p class='c007'>A classification of sins of non-injury, etc., may be made
according as they are actually done, or caused to be done, or
permitted to be done; and these again may be further divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>according as they are preceded by desire, anger or ignorance;
these are again mild, middling or intense. Thus we see that
there may be twenty-seven kinds of such sins. Mild, middling
and intense are each again threefold, mild-mild, mild-middling
and mild-intense; middling-mild, middling-middling and
middling-intense; also intense-mild, intense-middling and
intense-intense. Thus there are eighty-one kinds of sins. But
they become infinite on account of rules of restriction, option
and conjunction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrary tendency consists in the notion that these
immoral tendencies cause an infinity of pains and untrue
knowledge. Pain and unwisdom are the unending fruits of
these immoral tendencies, and in this idea lies the power which
produces the habit of giving a contrary trend to our thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>These yamas, together with the niyamas about to be
described, are called kriyāyoga, by the performance of which
men become fit to rise gradually to the state of jñānayoga by
samādhi and to attain kaivalya. This course thus represents
the first stage with which ordinary people should begin their
Yoga work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those more advanced, who naturally possess the virtues
mentioned in Yama, have no need of beginning here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it is said that some may begin with the niyamas,
asceticism, svādhyāya and devotion to God; it is for this
reason that, though mentioned under the niyamas, they are
also specially selected and spoken of as the kriyāyoga in the
very first rule of the second Book. Asceticism means the
strength of remaining unchanged in changes like that of heat
and cold, hunger and thirst, standing and sitting, absence of
speech and absence of all indications by gesture, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Svādhyāya means the study of philosophy and repetition of
the syllable “Aum.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This Īśvarapraṇidhāna (devotion to God) is different from
the Īśvarapraṇidhāna mentioned in <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite>, I. 23, where it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>meant love, homage and adoration of God, by virtue of which
God by His grace makes samādhi easy for the Yogin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here it is a kind of kriyāyoga, and hence it means the
bestowal of all our actions upon the Great Teacher, God, i.e.
to work, not for one’s own self but for God, so that a man
desists from all desires for fruit therefrom.</p>

<p class='c007'>When these are duly performed, the afflictions become
gradually attenuated and trance is brought about. The
afflictions thus attenuated become characterised by unproductiveness,
and when their seed-power has, as it were, been
burnt up by the fire of high intellection and the mind
untouched by afflictions realises the distinct natures of
purusha and sattva, it naturally returns to its own primal
cause prakṛti and kaivalya is attained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who are already far advanced do not require even
this kriyāyoga, as their afflictions are already in an attenuated
state and their minds in a fit condition to adapt themselves
to samādhi; they can therefore begin at once with jñānayoga.
So in the first chapter it is with respect to these advanced men
that it is said that kaivalya can be attained by abhyāsa and
vairāgya, without adopting the kriyāyoga (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, II. 2)
kriyāyogas. Only śauca and santosha now remain to be
spoken of. Śauca means cleanliness of body and mind.
Cleanliness of body is brought about by water, cleanliness of
mind by removal of the mental impurities of pride, jealousy
and vanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Santosha (contentment) is the absence of desire to possess
more than is necessary for the preservation of one’s life. It
should be added that this is the natural result of ceasing to
desire to appropriate the property of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of this section on the yamas and niyamas, it
is best to note their difference, which lies principally in this
that the former are the negative virtues, whereas the latter are
positive. The former can, and therefore must, be practised at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>all stages of Yoga, whereas the latter being positive are attainable
only by distinct growth of mind through Yoga. The
virtues of non-injury, truthfulness, sex restraint, etc., should
be adhered to at all stages of the Yoga practice. They are
indispensable for steadying the mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is said that in the presence of a person who has acquired
steadiness in ahiṃsā all animals give up their habits of enmity;
when a person becomes steady in truthfulness, whatever he says
becomes fulfilled. When a person becomes steady in asteya
(absence of theft) all jewels from all quarters approach him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Continence being confirmed, vigour is obtained. Non-covetousness
being confirmed, knowledge of the causes of
births is attained. By steadiness of cleanliness, disinclination
to this body and cessation of desire for other bodies is
obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the mind attains internal śauca, or cleanliness of
mind, his sattva becomes pure, and he acquires highmindedness,
one-pointedness, control of the senses and fitness for the
knowledge of self. By the steadiness of contentment comes
the acquisition of extreme happiness. By steadiness of
asceticism the impurities of this body are removed, and
from that come miraculous powers of endurance of the body
and also miraculous powers of the sense, viz. clairaudience
and thought-reading from a distance. By steadiness of
studies the gods, the ṛshis and the siddhas become visible.
When Īśvara is made the motive of all actions, trance is
attained. By this the Yogin knows all that he wants to know,
just as it is in reality, whether in another place, another body
or another time. His intellect knows everything as it is.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should not, however, be said, says Vācaspati, that
inasmuch as the saṃprajñāta is attained by making Īśvara
the motive of all actions, the remaining seven yogāṅgas are
useless. For the yogāṅgas are useful in the attainment of that
mental mood which devotes all actions to the purposes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Īśvara. They are also useful in the attainment of saṃprajñāta
samādhi by separate kinds of collocations, and samādhi
also leads to the fruition of saṃprajñāta, but though this
meditation on Īśvara is itself a species of Īśvarapraṇidhāna,
saṃprajñāta Yoga is a yet more direct means. As to the
relation of Īśvarapraṇidhāna with the other aṅgas of Yoga,
Bhikshu writes:—It cannot be asked what is the use of the
other disciplinary practices of the Yoga since Yoga can be
attained by meditation on Īśvara, for meditation on Īśvara
only removes ignorance. The other accessories bring about
samādhi by their own specific modes of operation. Moreover,
it is by help of meditation on Īśvara that one succeeds in
bringing about samādhi, through the performance of all the
accessories of Yoga; so the accessories of Yoga cannot be
regarded as unnecessary; for it is the accessories which
produce dhāraṇa, dhyāna and samādhi, through meditation
on God, and thereby salvation; devotion to God brings in His
grace and through it the yogāṅgas can be duly performed. So
though devotion to God may be considered as the direct cause,
it cannot be denied that the due performance of the yogāṅgas
is to be considered as the indirect cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Āsanas are secured when the natural involuntary movements
cease, and this may be effected by concentrating
the mind on the mythological snake which quietly bears the
burden of the earth on its head. Thus posture becomes
perfect and effort to that end ceases, so that there is no movement
of the body; or the mind is transformed into the infinite,
which makes the idea of infinity its own and then brings about
the perfection of posture. When posture has once been
mastered there is no disturbance through the contraries of
heat and cold, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>After having secured stability in the Āsanas the prāṇāyāmas
should be attempted. The pause that comes after a deep
inhalation and that after a deep exhalation are each called a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>prāṇāyāma; the first is external, the second internal. There
is, however, a third mode, by means of which, since the lungs
are neither too much dilated nor too much contracted, total
restraint is obtained; cessation of both these motions takes
place by a single effort, just as water thrown on a heated stone
shrivels up on all sides.</p>

<p class='c007'>These can be regulated by calculating the strength of
inhalation and exhalation through space, time or number.
Thus as the breathing becomes slower, the space that it
occupies also becomes smaller and smaller. Space again is of
two kinds, internal and external. At the time of inhalation,
the breath occupies internal space, which can be felt even in the
soles of hand and feet, like the slight touch of an ant. To try
to feel this touch along with deep inhalation serves to lengthen
the period of cessation of breathing. External space is the
distance from the tip of the nose to the remotest point at
which breath when inhaled can be felt, by the palm of the
hand, or by the movement of any light substance like cotton,
etc., placed there. Just as the breathing becomes slower and
slower, the distances traversed by it also becomes smaller
and smaller. Regulations by time is seen when the
attention is fixed upon the time taken up in breathing by
moments, a moment (<i>kshaṇa</i>) is the fourth part of the
twinkling of the eye. Regulation by time thus means the fact
of our calculating the strength of the prāṇāyāma the moments
or kshaṇas spent in the acts of inspiration, pause and respiration.
These prāṇāyāmas can also be measured by the number
of moments in the normal duration of breaths. The time
taken by the respiration and expiration of a healthy man is the
same as that measured by snapping the fingers after turning
the hand thrice over the knee and is the measure of duration of
normal breath; the first attempt or udghāta called mild is
measured by thirty-six such mātrās or measures; when doubled
it is the second udghāta called middling; when trebled it is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>third udghāta called intense. Gradually the Yogin acquires
the practice of prāṇāyāma of long duration, by daily practice
increasing in succession from a day, a fortnight, a month, etc.
Of course he proceeds first by mastering the first udghāta, then
the second, and so on until the duration increases up to a day,
a fortnight, a month as stated. There is also a fourth kind of
prāṇāyāma transcending all these stages of unsteady practice,
when the Yogin is steady in his cessation of breath. It must
be remembered, however, that while the prāṇāyāmas are being
practised, the mind must be fixed by dhyāna and dhāraṇā to
some object external or internal, without which these will be of
no avail for the true object of Yoga. By the practice of prāṇāyāma,
mind becomes fit for concentration as described in the
<i>sūtra</i> I. 34, where it is said that steadiness is acquired by
prāṇāyāma in the same way as concentration, as we also find
in the <i>sūtra</i> II. 53.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the senses are restrained from their external objects
by pratyāhāra we have what is called pratyāhāra, by which
the mind remains as if in its own nature, being altogether
identified with the object of inner concentration or contemplation;
and thus when the citta is again suppressed, the senses,
which have already ceased coming into contact with other
objects and become submerged in the citta, also cease along
with it. Dharaṇa is the concentration of citta on a particular
place, which is so very necessary at the time of prāṇāyāmas
mentioned before. The mind may thus be held steadfast in
such places as the sphere of the navel, the lotus of the heart,
the light in the brain, the forepart of the nose, the forepart of
the tongue, and such like parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dhyāna is the continuance or changing flow of the mental
effort in the object of dharaṇa unmediated by any other break
of conscious states.</p>

<p class='c007'>Samādhi, or trance contemplation, results when by deep
concentration mind becomes transformed into the shape of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>object of contemplation. By pratyāhāra or power of abstraction,
mind desists from all other objects, except the one on
which it is intended that it should be centred; the Yogin, as
he thus abstracts his mind, should also try to fix it upon some
internal or external object, which is called dhāraṇā; it must
also be noticed that to acquire the habit of dhāraṇā and in
order to inhibit the abstraction arising from shakiness and
unsteadiness of the body, it is necessary to practise steadfast
posture and to cultivate the prāṇāyāma. So too for the
purpose of inhibiting distractions arising from breathing.
Again, before a man can hope to attain steadfastness in these,
he must desist from any conduct opposed to the yamas, and
also acquire the mental virtues stated in the niyamas, and
thus secure himself against any intrusion of distractions arising
from his mental passions. These are the indirect and remote
conditions which qualify a person for attaining dhāraṇā,
dhyāna, and samādhi. A man who through his good deeds or
by the grace of God is already so much advanced that he is
naturally above all such distractions, for the removal of which
it is necessary to practise the yamas, the niyamas, the āsanas,
the prāṇāyāma and pratyāhara, may at once begin with
dhāraṇā; dhāraṇā we have seen means concentration, with
the advancement of which the mind becomes steady in
repeating the object of its concentration, i.e. thinking of that
thing alone and no other thing; thus we see that with the
practice of this state called dhyāna, or meditation, in which
the mind flows steadily in that one state without any interruption,
gradually even the conscious flow of this activity
ceases and the mind, transformed into the shape of the object
under concentration, becomes steady therein. We see therefore
that samādhi is the consummation of that process which
begins in dhāraṇā or concentration. These three, dhāraṇā,
dhyāna and samādhi, represent the three stages of the same
process of which the last one is the perfection; and these three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>are together technically called saṃyama, which directly leads
to and is immediately followed by the samprajñāta state,
whereas the other five yogāṅgas are only its indirect or remote
causes. These three are, however, not essential for the asamprajñāta
state, for a person who is very far advanced, or one
who is the special object of God’s grace, may pass at once by
intense vairāgya and abhyāsa into the nirodha state or state of
suppression.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the knowledge of samādhi gradually dawns through
the possession of saṃyama, so is the saṃyama gradually
strengthened. For this saṃyama also rises higher and higher
with the dawning of prajñāloka or light of samādhi knowledge.
This is the beginning, for here the mind can hold saṃyama or
concentrate and become one with a gross object together with
its name, etc., which is called the savitarka state; the next
plane or stage of saṃyama is that where the mind becomes one
with the object of its meditation, without any consciousness
of its name, etc. Next come the other two stages called
savicāra and nirvicāra when the mind is fixed on subtle
substances, as we shall see later on.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='c013'>STAGES OF SAMĀDHI</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Saṃprajñāta samādhi (absorptive concentration in an object)
may be divided into four classes, savitarka, nirvitarka, savicāra
and nirvicāra.</p>

<p class='c007'>To comprehend its scope we must first of all understand the
relation between a thing, its concept, and the particular name
with which the concept or thing is associated. It is easy to
see that the thing (<i>artha</i>), the concept (<i>jñāna</i>), and the name
(<i>śabda</i>) are quite distinct. But still, by force of association,
the word or name stands both for the thing and its concept;
the function of mind, by virtue of which despite this unreality
or want of their having any real identity of connection they
seem to be so much associated that the name cannot be
differentiated from the thing or its idea, is called vikalpa.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that state of samādhi in which the mind seems to
become one with the thing, together with its name and
concept, is the lowest stage of samādhi called savitarka; it is
the lowest stage, because here the gross object does not appear
to the mind in its true reality, but only in the false illusory way
in which it appears associated with the concept and the name
in ordinary life. This state does not differ from ordinary
conceptual states, in which the particular thing is not only
associated with the concepts and their names, but also with
other concepts and their various relations; thus a cow will
not only appear before the mind with its concept and name,
but also along with other relations and thoughts associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>with cows, as for example—“This is a cow, it belongs to so
and so, it has so many hairs on its body, and so forth.” This
state is therefore the first stage of samādhi, in which the mind
has not become steady and is not as yet beyond the range of
our ordinary consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nirvitarka stage arises from this when the mind by its
steadiness can become one with its object, divested of all other
associations of name and concept, so that it is in direct touch
with the reality of the thing, uncontaminated by associations.
The thing in this state does not appear to be an object of my
consciousness, but my consciousness becoming divested of all
“I” or “mine,” becomes one with the object itself; so that
there is no such notion here as “I know this,” but the mind
becomes one with the thing, so that the notion of subject and
object drops off and the result is the one steady transformation
of the mind into the object of its contemplation. This state
brings home to us real knowledge of the thing, divested from
other false and illusory associations, which far from explaining
the real nature of the object, serves only to hide it. This
samādhi knowledge or prajñā is called nirvitarka. The objects
of this state may be the gross material objects and the
senses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now this state is followed by the state of savicārā prajñā,
which dawns when the mind neglecting the grossness of the
object sinks deeper and deeper into its finer constituents;
the appearance of the thing in its grosser aspects drops off
and the mind having sunk deep, centres in and identifies itself
with the subtle tanmātras, which are the constituents of the
atoms, as a conglomeration of which the object appeared before
our eyes in the nirvitarka state. Thus when the mind, after
identifying itself with the sun in its true aspect as pure light,
tends to settle on a still finer state of it, either by making the
senses so steady that the outward appearance vanishes, or by
seeking finer and finer stages than the grosser manifestation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>light as such, it apprehends the tanmātric state of the light
and knows it as such, and we have what is called the savicāra
stage. It has great similarities with the savitarka stage, while
its differences from that stage spring from the fact that here
the object is the tanmātra and not the gross bhūta. The mind
in this stage holding communion with the rūpa tanmātra, for
example, is not coloured variously as red, blue, etc., as in the
savitarka communion with gross light, for the tanmātric light
or light potential has no such varieties as different kinds of
colour, etc., so that there are also no such different kinds of
feeling of pleasure or pain as arise from the manifold varieties
of ordinary light. This is a state of feelingless representation
of one uniform tanmātric state, when the object appears
as a conglomeration of tanmātras of rūpa, rasa or gandha, as
the case might be. This state, however, is not indeterminate, as
the nirvitarka stage, for this tanmātric conception is associated
with the notions of time, space and causality, for the mind
here feels that it sees those tanmātras which are in such a
subtle state that they are not associated with pleasures and
pains. They are also endowed with causality in such a way
that from them and their particular collocations originate the
atoms.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be noted here that the subtle objects of concentration
in this stage are not the tanmātras alone, but also other
subtle substances including the ego, the buddhi and the
prakṛti.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when the mind acquires the complete habit of this
state in which it becomes identified with these fine objects—the
tanmātras—etc., then all conceptual notions of the
associations of time, space, causality, etc., spoken of in the
savicāra and the savitarka state vanish away and it becomes
one with the fine object of its communion. These two kinds
of prajñā, savicāra and nirvicāra, arising from communion with
the fine tanmātras, have been collocated under one name as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>vicārānugata. But when the object of communion is the
senses, the samādhi is called ānandānugata, and when the
object of communion is the subtle cause the ego (<i>asmitā</i>), the
samādhi is known as asmitānugata.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a difference of opinion regarding the object of the
last two varieties of samādhi, viz. ānandānugata and asmitānugata,
and also about the general scheme of division of the
samādhis. Vācaspati thinks that <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite> I. 41 suggests the
interpretation that the saṃprajñāta samādhis may be divided
into three different classes according as their objects of
concentration belong to one or other of the three different
planes of grāhya (external objects), grahaṇa (the senses) and
grahītṛ (the ego). So he refers vitarka and vicāra to the plane
of grāhya (physical objects and tanmātras), ānandānugata to
the plane of grahaṇa (the senses) and asmitānugata to the plane
of grahītṛ. Bhikshu, however, disapproves of such an interpretation.
He holds that in ānandānugata the object of
concentration is bliss (ānanda) and not the senses. When the
Yogin rises to the vicārānugata stage there is a great flow of
sattva which produces bliss, and at this the mind becomes one
with this ānanda or bliss, and this samādhi is therefore called
ānandānugata. Bhikshu does not think that in asmitānugata
samādhi the object of concentration is the ego. He thinks
that in this stage the object of concentration is the concept of
self (<i>kevalapurushākārā saṃvit</i>) which has only the form of ego
or “I” (<i>asmītyetāvanmātrākāratvādasmitā</i>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Again according to Vācaspati in addition to the four varieties
of savitarka, nirvitarka, savicāra and nirvicāra there are two
varieties of ānandanugata as sānanda and nirānanda and two
varieties of asmitānugata as sāsmita and nirasmita. This
gives us eight different kinds of samādhi. With Bhikshu there
are only six kinds of samādhi, for he admits only one variety
as ānandānugata and one variety as asmitānugata. Bhikshu’s
classification of samādhis is given below in a tabular form (see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Vācaspati’s <cite>Tattvavaiśāradī</cite> and <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, I. 17, 41, 42,
43, 44).</p>

<p class='c007'> (with association of
 name and concept
 of the tanmātras) 4. nirvicāra (without association of name, etc.)'</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the nirvicāra state our minds become altogether
purified and there springs the prajñā or knowledge called
ṛtambharā or true; this true knowledge is altogether different
from the knowledge which is derived from the Vedas or from
inferences or from ordinary perceptions; for the knowledge
that it can give of Reality can never be had by any other
means, by perception, inference or testimony, for their communication
is only by the conceptual process of generalisations
and abstractions and these can never help us to affirm
anything about things as they are in themselves, which are
altogether different from their illusory demonstrations in
conceptual terms which only prevent us from knowing the true
reality. The potency of this prajñā arrests the potency of
ordinary states of consciousness and thus attains stability.
When, however, this prajñā is also suppressed, we have what is
called the state of nirvīja samādhi, at the end of which comes
final prajñā leading to the dissolution of the citta and the
absolute freedom of the purusha.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Samādhi we have seen is the mind’s becoming one with an
object by a process of acute concentration upon it and a continuous
repetition of it with the exclusion of all other thoughts
of all kinds. We have indeed described the principal stages
of the advancement of samprajñāta Yoga, but it is impossible
to give an exact picture of it with the symbolical expressions of
our concepts; for the stages only become clear to the mental
vision of the Yogin as he gradually acquires firmness in his
practice. The Yogin who is practising at once comes to know
them as the higher stages gradually dawn in his mind and
he distinguishes them from each other; it is thus a matter
of personal experience, so that no teacher can tell him
whether a certain stage which follows is higher or lower, for
Yoga itself is its own teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even when the mind is in the samprajñāta state it is said
to be in vyutthāna (phenomenal) in comparison with the
nirodha state, just as the ordinary conscious states are called
vyutthāna in comparison with the samprajñāta state; the
potencies of the samprajñāta state become weaker and weaker,
while the potencies of the nirodha state become stronger and
stronger until finally the mind comes to the nirodha state and
becomes stable therein; of course this contains within itself a
long mental history, for the potency of the nirodha state can
become stronger only when the mind practises it and remains
in this suppressed condition for long intervals of time. This
shows that the mind, being made up of the three guṇas, is
always suffering transformations and changes. Thus from the
ordinary state of phenomenal consciousness it gradually
becomes one-pointed and then gradually becomes transformed
into the state of an object (internal or external), when it is
said to be undergoing the samādhi pariṇāma or samādhi
change of the samprajñāta type; next comes the change,
when the mind passes from the samprajñāta stage to the state
of suppression (<i>nirodha</i>). Here also, therefore, we see that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>same dharma, lakshṇa, avasthāpariṇāma which we have
already described at some length with regard to sensible objects
apply also to the mental states. Thus the change from the
vyutthāna (ordinary experience) to the nirodha state is the
dharmapariṇāma, the change as manifested in time, so that
we can say that the change of vyutthāna into nirodha has not
yet come, or has just come, or that the vyutthāna state
(ordinary experience) exists no longer, the mind having transformed
itself into the nirodha state. There is also here the
third change of condition, when we see that the potencies of
the samprajñāta state become weaker and weaker, while that
of the nirodha state becomes stronger and stronger. These are
the three kinds of change which the mind undergoes called the
dharma, lakshaṇa and avasthā change. But there is one
difference between this change thus described from the
changes observed in sensible objects that here the changes are
not visible but are only to be inferred by the passage of the
mind from one state to another.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said that there are two different kinds of qualities
of the mind, visible and invisible. The visible qualities whose
changes can be noticed are conscious states, or thought-products,
or percepts, etc. The invisible ones are seven in
number and cannot be directly seen, but their existence and
changes or modifications may be established by inference.
These are suppression, characterisation, subconscious maintenance
of experience, constant change, life, movement and
power or energy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with samprajñāta samādhi some miraculous
attainments are described, which are said to strengthen the
faith or belief of the Yogin in the processes of Yoga as the
path of salvation. These are like the products or the mental
experiments in the Yoga method, by which people may
become convinced of the method of Yoga as being the true one.
No reasons are offered as to the reason for these attainments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>but they are said to happen as a result of mental union
with different objects. It is best to note them here in a
tabular form.</p>

<p class='c007'>These vibhūtis, as they rise with the performance of the
processes of Yoga, gradually deepen the faith <i>śraddha</i> of the

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='c013'>GOD IN YOGA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After describing the nature of karmayoga, and the way in
which it leads to jñānayoga, we must now describe the third
and easiest means of attaining salvation, the bhaktiyoga and
the position of Īśvara in the Yoga system, with reference to a
person who seeks deliverance from the bonds and shackles of
avidyā.</p>

<p class='c007'>Īśvara in the Yoga system is that purusha who is distinguished
from all others by the fact of his being untouched by the
afflictions or the fruits of karma. Other purushas are also in
reality untouched by the afflictions, but they, seemingly at
least, have to undergo the afflictions and consequently birth
and rebirth, etc., until they are again finally released; but
Īśvara, though he is a purusha, yet does not suffer in any way
any sort of bondage. He is always free and ever the Lord.
He never had nor will have any relation to these bonds. He is
also the teacher of the ancient teachers beyond the range of
conditioning time.</p>

<p class='c007'>This nature of Īśvara has been affirmed in the scriptures
and is therefore taken as true on their authority. The
authority of the scriptures is again acknowledged only because
they have proceeded from God or Īśvara. The objection that
this is an argument in a circle has no place here, since the
connection of the scriptures with Īśvara is beginningless.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no other divinity equal to Īśvara, because in the
case of such equality there might be opposition between rival
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Īśvaras, which might result in the lowering in degree of any
of them. He is omniscient in the highest degree, for in him is
the furthest limit of omniscience, beyond which there is nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Īśvara is all-merciful, and though he has no desires to
satisfy, yet for the sake of his devotees he dictates the Vedas
at each evolution of the world after dissolution. But he does
not release all persons, because he helps only so far as each
deserves; he does not nullify the law of karma, just as a king,
though quite free to act in any way he likes, punishes or
rewards people as they deserve.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of each kalpa, he adopts pure body from his
sattva, which is devoid of any karmāśaya, and thus communicates
through it to all his devotees and dictates
the Vedas. Again at the time of dissolution this body
of pure sattva becomes submerged in prakṛti; and at the
time of its submersion, Īśvara wishes that it might come forth
again at the beginning of the new creation; thus for ever at
each new creation the pure sattva body springs forth and is
submerged again into prakṛti at the time of the dissolution
of the universe.</p>

<p class='c007'>In accepting this body he has no personal desires to satisfy,
as we have said before. He adopts it only for the purpose of
saving mankind by instructing them as to knowledge and
piety, which is not possible without a pure sattvamaya body;
so he adopts it, but is not affected in any way by it. One who
is under the control of nescience cannot distinguish his real
nature from nescience, and thus is always led by it, but such is
not the case with Īśvara, for he is not in any way under its
control, but only adopts it as a means of communicating
knowledge to mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Yogin also who has attained absolute independence may
similarly accept one or more pure sattvamaya nirmāṇa cittas
from asmitāmātra and may produce one citta as the superintendent
of all these. Such a citta adopted by a true Yogin by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the force of his meditation is not under the control of the
vehicles of action as is the case with the other four kinds of
citta from birth, oshadhi, mantra and tapas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The praṇava or oṃkāra is his name; though at the time of
dissolution, the word of praṇava together with its denotative
power becomes submerged in the prakṛti, to reappear with
the new creation, just as roots shoot forth from the ground in
the rainy season. This praṇava is also called svādhyāya. By
concentration of this svādhyāya or praṇava, the mind becomes
one-pointed and fit for Yoga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now one of the means of attaining Yoga is Īśvarapraṇidhāna,
or worship of God. This word, according to the commentators,
is used in two senses in the first and the second
books of the Pātañjala Yoga aphorisms. In the first book it
means love or devotion to God as the one centre of meditation,
in the second it is used to mean the abnegation of all desires
of the fruits of action to Īśvara, and thus Īśvarapraṇidhāna
in this sense is included under kriyāyoga. This dedication of
all fruits of action to Īśvara, purifies the mind and makes it
fit for Yoga and is distinguished from the Īśvarapraṇidhāna
of the first book as the bhāvanā of praṇava and Īśvara in this
that it is connected with actions and the abnegation of their
fruits, whereas the latter consists only in keeping the mind in
a worshipful state towards Īśvara and his word or name
praṇava.</p>

<p class='c007'>By devotion (bhakti) Īśvara is drawn towards the devotee
through his nirmāṇa citta of pure sattva and by his grace he
removes all obstructions of illness, etc., described in I. 30, 31,
and at once prepares his mind for the highest realisation of his
own absolute independence. So for a person who can love and
adore Īśvara, this is the easiest course of attaining samādhi.
We can make our minds pure most easily by abandoning
all our actions to Īśvara and attaining salvation by firm and
steady devotion to Him. This is the sphere of bhaktiyoga by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>which the tedious complexity of the Yoga process may be
avoided and salvation speedily acquired by the supreme grace
of Īśvara.</p>

<p class='c007'>This means is not, however, distinct from the general means
of Yoga, viz. abhyāsa and vairāgya, which applies to all stages.
For here also abhyāsa applies to the devotion of Īśvara as one
supreme truth and vairāgya is necessarily associated with all
true devotion and adoration of Īśvara.</p>

<p class='c007'>This conception of Īśvara differs from the conception of
Īśvara in the Rāmānuja system in this that there prakṛti and
purusha, acit and cit, form the body of Īśvara, whereas here
Īśvara is considered as being only a special purusha with the
aforesaid powers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this system Īśvara is not the superintendent of
prakṛti in the sense of the latter’s remaining in him in an
undifferentiated way, but is regarded as the superintendent
of dharma and adharma, and his agency is active only in the
removal of obstacles, thereby helping the evolutionary
process of prakṛti.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Īśvara is distinguished from the Īśvara of Saṅkara
Vedānta in this that there true existence is ascribed only to
Īśvara, whereas all other forms and modes of Being are only
regarded as illusory.</p>

<p class='c007'>From what we have seen above it is clear that the main
stress of the Yoga philosophy is on the method of samādhi.
The knowledge that can be acquired by it differs from all
other kinds of knowledge, ordinary perception, inference,
etc., in this that it alone can bring objects before our
mental eye with the clearest and most unerring light of
comprehensibility in which the true nature of the thing is at
once observed. Inferences and the words of scriptures are
based on concepts or general notions of things. For the
teaching of the Vedas is manifested in words; and words are
but names, terms or concepts formed by noting the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>similarities of certain things and binding them down by a
symbol. All deductive inferences are also based upon major
propositions arrived at by inductive generalisations; so it is
easy to see that all knowledge that can be acquired by them is
only generalised conceptions. Their process only represents
the method by which the mind can pass from one generalised
conception to another; so the mind can in no way attain the
knowledge of real things, absolute species, which are not the
genus of any other thing; so inference and scripture can only
communicate to us the nature of the agreement or similarity
of things and not the real things as they are. Ordinary
perception also is not of much avail here, since it cannot bring
within its scope subtle and fine things and things that are
obstructed from the view of the senses. But samādhi has
no such limitations and the knowledge that can be attained
by it is absolutely unobstructed, true and real in the strictest
sense of the terms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the points of difference between Yoga and Sāṃkhya
the admission of Īśvara by the former and the emphasis given
by it to the Yoga practice are the most important in
distinguishing it from the latter. It seems probable that
Īśvara was traditionally believed in the Yoga school to be a
protector of the Yogins proceeding in their arduous course of
complete self-control and absorptive concentration. The
chances of a person adopting the course of Yoga practice for
the attainment of success in this field does not depend only on
the exertions of the Yogin, but upon the concurrence of many
convenient circumstances such as physical fitness, freedom from
illnesses and other obstacles. Faith in the patronage of God in
favour of honest workers and believers served to pacify their
minds and fill them with the cheerful hope and confidence
which were so necessary for the success of Yoga practice.
The metaphysical functions which are ascribed to Īśvara
seem to be later additions for the sake of rendering his position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>more in harmony with the system. Mere faith in Īśvara
for the practical benefit of the Yogins is thus interpreted by a
reference to his superintendence of the development of
cosmic evolution. Sāṃkhya relied largely on philosophical
thinking leading to proper discrimination as to the difference
between prakrti and purusha which is the stage immediately
antecedent to emancipation. There being thus no practical
need for the admission of Īśvara, the theoretical need was also
ignored and it was held that the inherent teleological purpose
(<i>purushārthatā</i>) of prakṛti was sufficient to explain all the
stages of cosmic evolution as well as its final separation from
the purushas.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have just seen that Sāṃkhya does not admit the existence
of God, and considers that salvation can be obtained only
by a steady perseverance in philosophical thinking, and does
not put emphasis on the practical exercises which are
regarded as essential by the Yoga. One other point of
difference ought to be noted with regard to the conception of
avidyā. According to Yoga, avidyā, as we have already
explained it, means positive untrue beliefs such as believing the
impure, uneternal, sorrow, and non-self to be the pure eternal,
pleasure and the self respectively. With Sāṃkhya, however,
avidyā is only the non-distinction of the difference between
prakṛti and purusha. Both Sāṃkhya and Yoga admit that
our bondage to prakṛti is due to an illusion or ignorance
(avidyā), but Sāṃkhya holds the akhyāti theory which
regards non-distinction of the difference as the cause of
illusion whereas the Yoga holds the anyathākhyāti theory
which regards positive misapprehension of the one as the
other to be the cause of illusion. We have already referred to
the difference in the course of the evolution of the categories
as held by Sāṃkhya and Yoga. This also accounts for the
difference between the technical terms of prakṛti, vikṛti and
prakṛti-vikṛti of Sāṃkhya and the viśesha and aviśesha of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>the Yoga. The doctrine of dharma, lakshaṇa and avasthāpariṇāma,
though not in any way antagonistic to Sāṃkhya, is
not so definitely described as in the Yoga. Some scholars
think that Sāṃkhya did not believe in atoms as Yoga did.
But though the word paramāṇu has not been mentioned in the
<cite>Kārikā</cite>, it does not seem that Sāṃkhya did not believe in
atoms; and we have already noticed that Bhikshu considers
the word sūkshma in <cite>Kārikā</cite> 39 as referring to the atoms.
There are also slight differences with regard to the process
involved in perception and this has been dealt with in my
<cite>Yoga philosophy in relation to other Indian systems of
thought</cite>.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> On almost all other fundamental points Sāṃkhya
and Yoga are in complete agreement.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In conclusion it may be worth while saying a few words as to
theories of the physical world supplementary to the views
that have already been stated above.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gross matter, as the possibility of sensation, has been
divided into five classes, according to their relative grossness,
corresponding to the relative grossness of the senses. Some
modern investigators have tried to understand the five bhūtas,
viz. ākāśa, marut, tejas, ap and kshiti as ether, gaseous heat and
light, liquids and solids. But I cannot venture to agree when
I reflect that solidity, liquidity and gaseousness represent only
an impermanent aspect of matter. The division of matter
from the standpoint of the possibility of our sensations, has a
firm root in our nature as cognising beings and has therefore a
better rational footing than the modern chemical division
into elements and compounds, which are being daily threatened
by the gradual advance of scientific culture. This carries with
it no fixed and consistent rational conception as do the
definitions of the ancients, but is a mere makeshift for understanding
or representing certain chemical changes of matter
and has therefore a merely relative value.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are five aspects from which gross matter can be
viewed. These are (1) sthūla (gross), (2) svarūpa (substantive),
(3) sūkshma (subtle), (4) anvaya (conjunction), (5) arthavattva
(purpose for use). The sthūla or gross physical characteristics
of the bhūtas are described as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Qualities of Earth—Form, heaviness, roughness, obstruction,
stability, manifestation (vṛtti), difference, support,
turbidity, hardness and enjoyability.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ap—Smoothness, subtlety, clearness, whiteness, softness,
heaviness, coolness, conservation, purity, cementation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tejas—Going upwards, cooking, burning, light, shining,
dissipating, energising.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vāyu—Transverse motion, purity, throwing, pushing,
strength, movability, want of shadow.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ākāśa—Motion in all directions, non-agglomeration, non-obstruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>These physical characteristics are distinguished from the
aspects by which they appeal to the senses, which are called
their svarūpas. Earth is characterised by gandha or smell,
ap by rasa or taste, tejas by rūpa, etc. Looked at from this
point of view, we see that smell arises by the contact of the
nasal organ with the hard particles of matter; so this hardness
or solidity which can so generate the sensibility of gandha, is
said to be the svarūpa of kshiti. Taste can originate only in
connection with liquidity, so this liquidity or sneha is the
svarūpa or nature of ap. Light—the quality of visibility—manifests
itself in connection with heat, so heat is the svarūpa
of fire. The sensibility of touch is generated in connection
with the vibration of air on the epidermal surface; so this
vibratory nature is the svarūpa of air.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sensibility to sound proceeds from the nature of
obstructionlessness, which belongs to ākāśa, so this obstructionlessness
is the svarūpa of ākāśa.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third aspect is the aspect of tanmātras, which are the
causes of the atoms or paramāṇus. Their fourth aspect is
their aspect of guṇas or qualities of illumination, action,
inertia. Their fifth aspect is that by which they are serviceable
to purusha, by causing his pleasurable or painful experiences
and finally his liberation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Speaking of aggregation with regard to the structure of
matter, we see that this is of two kinds (1) when the parts are
in intimate union and fusion, e.g. any vegetable or animal
body, the parts of which can never be considered separately.
(2) When there are such mechanical aggregates or collocations
of distinct and independent parts <i>yutasiddhāvayava</i> as the
trees in a forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>A dravya or substance is an aggregate of the former type,
and is the grouping of generic or specific qualities and is not a
separate entity—the abode of generic and specific qualities
like the dravya of the Vaiśeshika conception. The aspect of an
unification of generic and specific qualities seen in parts united
in intimate union and fusion is called the dravya aspect. The
aggregation of parts is the structural aspect of which the side
of appearance is the unification of generic and specific qualities
called the dravya.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other aggregation of yutasiddhāvayava, i.e. the
collocation of the distinct and independent parts, is again of
two kinds, (1) in which stress may be laid on the distinction of
parts, and (2) that in which stress is laid on their unity rather
than on their distinctness. Thus in the expression mango-grove,
we see that many mangoes make a grove, but the
mangoes are not different from the grove. Here stress is laid
on the aspect that mangoes are the same as the grove, which,
however, is not the case when we say that here is a grove of
mangoes, for the expression “grove of mangoes” clearly
brings home to our minds the side of the distinct mango-trees
which form a grove.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the gross elements, ākāśa seems especially to require a
word of explanation. There are according to Vijñāna
Bhikshu and Nāgeśa two kinds of ākāśa—kāraṇa (or primal)
and kārya (atomic). The first or original is the undifferentiated
formless tamas, for in that stage it has not the quality of
manifesting itself in sounds. This kāraṇa later on develops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>into the atomic ākāśa, which has the property of sound.
According to the conception of the purāṇas, this karyākāśa
evolves from the ego as the first envelope of vāyu or air. The
kāraṇakāśa or non-atomic ākāśa should not be considered
as a mere vacuum, but must be conceived as a positive,
all-pervasive entity, something like the ether of modern
physicists.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this ākāśa springs the atomic ākāśa or kāryākāśa,
which is the cause of the manifestation of sound. All powers
of hearing, even though they have their origin in the principle
of egoism, reside in the ākāśa placed in the hollow of the ear.
When soundness or defect is noticed therein, soundness or
defect is also noticed in the power of hearing. Further, when
of the sounds working in unison with the power of hearing, the
sounds of solids, etc., are to be apprehended, then the power of
hearing located in the hollow of the ear requires the capacity of
resonance residing in the substratum of the ākāśa of the ear.
This sense of hearing, then, operates when it is attracted by
the sound originated and located in the mouth of the speaker,
which acts as a loadstone. It is this ākāśa which gives penetrability
to all bodies; in the absence of this, all bodies would be
so compact that it would be difficult to pierce them even with
a needle. In the <cite>Sāṃkhya-sūtra</cite> II. 12, it is said that eternal
time and space are of the nature of ākāśa. So this so-called
eternal time and space do not differ from the one undifferentiated
formless tamas of which we have just spoken.
Relative and infinite time arise from the motion of atoms in
space—the cause of all change and transformation; and space
as relative position cannot be better expressed than in the
words of Dr. B. N. Seal, as “totality of positions as an order of
co-existent points, and as such it is wholly relative to the
understanding like order in time, being constructed on the
basis of relations of position intuited by our empirical or
relative consciousness. But there is this difference between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>space order and time order:—there is no unit of space as
position (<i>dik</i>) though we may conceive time, as the moment
(<i>kshaṇa</i>) regarded as the unit of change in the causal series.
Spatial position (<i>dik</i>) results only from the different relations
in which the all-pervasive ākāśa stands to the various finite
objects. On the other hand, space as extension or locus of a
finite body, or deśa, has an ultimate unit, being analysable
into the infinitesimal extension quality inherent in the guṇas
of prakṛti.”<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Citta or mind has two degrees: (1) the form of states such
as real cognition, including perception, inference, competent
evidence, unreal cognition, imagination, sleep and memory.
(2) In the form in which all those states are suppressed.
Between the stage of complete outgoing activity of ordinary
experience (<i>vyutthāna</i>) and complete suppression of all states,
there are thousands of states of infinite variety, through which
a man’s experiences have to pass, from the vyutthāna state to
the nirodha. In addition to the five states spoken of above,
there is another kind of real knowledge and intuition, called
prajñā, which dawns when by concentration the citta is
fixed upon any one state and that alone. This prajñā is
superior to all other means of knowledge, whether perception,
inference or competent evidence of the Vedas, in this, that
it is altogether unerring, unrestricted and unlimited in its
scope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pramāṇa, we have seen, includes perception, inference and
competent evidence. Perception originates when the mind or
citta, through the senses (ear, skin, eye, taste and nose) is
modified by external objects and passes to them, generating a
kind of knowledge about them in which their specific characters
become more predominant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mind is all-pervasive and can come in touch with the
external world, by which we have the perception of the thing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Like light, which emits rays and pervades all, though it remains
in one place, the citta by its vṛttis comes in contact with the
external world, is changed into the form of the object of
perception and thus becomes the cause of perception; as the
citta has to pass through the senses, it becomes coloured by
them, which explains the fact that perception is impossible
without the help of the senses. As it has to pass through the
senses, it undergoes the limitations of the senses, which it
can avoid, if it can directly concentrate itself upon any object
without the help of the senses; from this originates the
prajñā, through which dawns absolute real knowledge of the
thing; unhampered by the limitations of the senses which
can act only within a certain area or distance and cannot
cognize subtler objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see that in ordinary perception our minds are drawn
towards the object, as iron is attracted by magnets. Thus
Bhikshu says in explaining <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite> IV. 17:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The objects of knowledge, though inactive in themselves,
may yet draw the everchanging cittas towards them like a
magnet and change them in accordance with their own forms,
just as a piece of cloth is turned red by coming into contact
with red lac.” So it is that the cittas attain the form of anything
with which they come in touch and there is then the
perception that that thing is known. Perception (<i>pratyaksha</i>)
is distinguished from inference, etc., in this, that here the
knowledge arrived at is predominantly of the specific and
special characters (<i>viśesha</i>) of the thing and not of its generic
qualities us in inference, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inference proceeds from inference, and depends upon the
fact that certain common qualities are found in all the members
of a class, as distinguished from the members of a different
class. Thus the qualities affirmed of a class will be found to
exist in all the individual members of that class; this
attribution of the generic characters of a class to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>individual members that come under it is the essence of
inference.</p>

<p class='c007'>An object perceived or inferred by a competent man is
described by him in words with the intention of transferring
his knowledge to another; and the mental modification, which
has for its sphere the meaning of such words, is the verbal
cognition of the hearer. When the speaker has neither
perceived nor inferred the object, and speaks of things which
cannot be believed, the authority of verbal cognition fails. But
it does not fail in the original speaker, God or Īśvara, and his
dictates the Śāstras with reference either to the object of
perception or of inference.</p>

<p class='c007'>Viparyyaya or unreal cognition is the knowledge of the unreal
as in doubt—a knowledge which possesses a form that does
not tally with the real nature of the thing either as doubt or as
false knowledge. Doubt may be illustrated by taking the case
of a man who sees something in dim light and doubts its nature.
“Is it a wooden post or a man?” In nature there is either
the wooden post or the man, but there is no such fact or entity
which corresponds with doubt: “Is it a wooden post or a
man?” Knowledge as doubt is not cognition of a fact or
entity. The illusion of seeing all things yellow through a
defect of the eye (as in jaundice) can only be corrected when
the objects are seen in their true colours. In doubt, however,
their defective nature is at once manifest. Thus when we
cannot be sure whether a certain thing is a post or a man, we
know that our knowledge is not definite. So we have not to
wait till the illusoriness of the previous knowledge is demonstrated
by the advent of right knowledge. The evil nature of
viparyyaya is exemplified in avidyā nescience, asmitā,
rāga, etc.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Viparyyaya is distinguished from vikalpa—imagination—in
this, that though the latter is also unreal knowledge its nature
as such is not demonstrated by any knowledge that follows,
but is on the contrary admitted on all sides by the common
consent of mankind. But it is only the learned who can
demonstrate by arguments the illusoriness of vikalpa or
imagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>All class notions and concepts are formed by taking note
only of the general characters of things and associating them
with a symbol called “name.” Things themselves, however,
do not exist in the nature of these symbols or names or
concepts; it is only an aspect of them that is diagrammatically
represented by the intellect in the form of concepts.
When concepts are united or separated in our thought and
language, they consequently represent only an imaginary plane
of knowledge, for the things are not as the concepts represent
them. Thus when we say “Caitra’s cow,” it is only an
imaginary relation for, strictly speaking, no such thing exists
as the cow of Caitra. Caitra has no connection in reality with
the cow. When we say purusha is of the nature of consciousness,
there is the same illusory relation. Now what is here
predicated of what? Purusha is consciousness itself, but in
predication there must always be a statement of the relation of
one to another. Thus it sometimes breaks a concept into two
parts and predicates the one of the other, and sometimes
predicates the unity of two concepts which are different. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>its sphere has a wide latitude in all thought-process conducted
through language and involves an element of abstraction and
construction which is called vikalpa. This represents the
faculty by which our concepts are arranged in an analytical or
synthetical proposition. It is said to be <i>śabdajñānānupāti
vastuśūnyo vikalpaḥ</i>, i.e. the knowledge that springs from
relating concepts or names, which relating does not actually
exist in the objective world as it is represented in propositional
forms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sleep is that mental state which has for its objective
substratum the feeling of emptiness. It is called a state or
notion of mind, for it is called back on awakening; when
we feel that we have slept well our minds are clear, when we
have slept badly our minds are listless, wandering and
unsteady. For a person who seeks to attain communion or
samādhi, these desires of sleep are to be suppressed, like all
other desires. Memory is the retaining in the mind of objects
perceived when perception occurs by the union of the cittas
with external objects, according to the forms of which the
cittas are transformed; it retains these perceptions, as
impressions or saṃskāras by means of its inherent tamas.
These saṃskāras generate memory, when such events occur as
can manifest them by virtue of associations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus memory comes when the percepts already known and
acquired are kept in the mind in the form of impressions and
are manifested by the udbodhakas or associative manifestors.
It differs from perceptions in this that the latter are of the
nature of perceiving the unknown and unperceived, whereas
the former serves to bring before the mind percepts that have
already been acquired. Memory is therefore of percepts
already acquired by real cognition, unreal cognition,
imagination, sleep and memory. It manifests itself in dreams
as well as in waking states.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relation between these states of mind and the saṃskāras
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>is this that their frequency and repetition strengthens the
saṃskāras and thus ensures the revival of these states.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are all endowed with sukha (pleasure), duḥkha (pain)
and moha (ignorance). These feelings cannot be treated
separately from the states themselves, for their manifestations
are not different from the manifestation of the states themselves.
Knowledge and feeling are but two different aspects
of the modifications of cittas derived from prakṛti; hence
neither can be thought separately from the other. The fusion
of feeling with knowledge is therefore here more fundamental
than in the modern tripartite division of mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this we are to consider the senses whose
action on the external world is known as “perceiving,”
“grahaṇa,” which is distinguished from “pratyaksha,” which
means the effect of “perceiving,” viz. perception. Each sense
has got its special sphere of work, e.g. sight is of the eye, and
this is called their second aspect, viz. svarūpa. Their third
aspect is of “asmitā” or ego, which manifests itself through
the senses. Their fourth aspect is their characteristic of guṇas,
viz. that of manifestation (<i>prakāśa</i>), action (<i>kriyā</i>) and retention
(<i>sthiti</i>). Their fifth aspect is that they are set in motion
for purusha, his experiences and liberation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is indeed difficult to find the relation of manas with the
senses and the cittas. In more than one place manas is
identified with cittas, and, on the other hand, it is described
as a sense organ. There is another aspect in which manas is
said to be the king of the cognitive and motor senses. Looked
at in this aspect, manas is possibly the directive side of the ego
by which it guides the cognitive and conative senses in the
external world and is the cause of their harmonious activity for
the experience of purusha. As a necessary attribute of this
directive character of manas, the power of concentration,
which is developed by prāṇāyāma, is said to belong to manas.
This is the rajas side of manas.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>There is another aspect of manas which is called the anuvyavasāya
or reflection, by which the sensations (ālocana) are
associated, differentiated, integrated, assimilated into percepts
and concepts. This is possibly the sāttvika side of manas.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another aspect by which the percepts and concepts
are retained (<i>dhāraṇa</i>) in the mind as saṃskāras, to be
repeated or revealed again in the mind as actual states. This
is the tamas side of manas.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this we may mention ūha (positive
argumentation), apoha (negative argumentation) and tattvajñāna
(logical conclusion) which are the modes of different
anuvyavasāyas of the manas. Will, etc., are to be included
with these (<cite>Yoga-varttikā</cite>, II. 18). Looked at from the
point of view of cittas, these may equally be regarded as the
modifications of cittas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The motives which sustain this process of outgoing activity
are false knowledge, and such other emotional elements as
egoism, attachment, aversion, and love of life. These
emotional elements remain in the mind in the germinal state
as power alone; or they exist in a fully operative state when a
man is under the influence of any one of them; or they
alternate with others, such as attachment or aversion; or they
may become attenuated by meditation upon opposites.
Accordingly they are called respectively prasupta, udāra,
vicchinna or tanu. Man’s minds or cittas may follow these
outgoing states or experiences, or gradually remove those
emotions which are commonly called afflictions, thus narrowing
their sphere and proceeding towards final release.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the psychic states described above, viz. pramāṇa,
viparyyaya, etc., are called either afflicted or unafflicted
according as they are moved towards outgoing activity or
are actuated by the higher motive of emancipation by
narrowing the field of experiences gradually to a smaller and
smaller sphere and afterwards to suppress them altogether.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>These two kinds of motives, one of afflictions that lead towards
external objects of attachment and aversion or love of life, and
the other which leads to striving for kaivalya, are the sole
motives which guide all human actions and psychic states.</p>

<p class='c007'>They influence us whenever suitable opportunities occur,
so that by the study of the Vedas, self-criticism or right argumentation,
or from the instruction of good men, abhyāsa and
vairāgya may be roused by vidyā. Right knowledge and a
tendency towards kaivalya may appear in the mind even
when a man is immersed in the afflicted states of outgoing
activity. So also afflicted states may appear when a man is
bent upon or far advanced in those actions which are roused
by vidyā or the tendency towards kaivalya.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems that the Yoga view of actions, or karma, does not
deprive man of his freedom of will. The habit of performing
particular types of action only strengthens the corresponding
subconscious impressions or saṃskāras of those actual states,
and thus makes it more and more difficult to overcome their
propensity to generate their corresponding actual states, and
thus obstructs the adoption of an unhampered and free course
of action. The other limitation to the scope of the activity of
his free will is the vāsanā aspect of the saṃskāras by which he
naturally feels himself attached by pleasurable ties to certain
experiences and by painful ones to others. But these only
represent the difficulties and impediments which come to
a man, when he has to adopt the Yoga course of life, the contrary
of which he might have been practising for a very long
period, extending over many life-states.</p>

<p class='c007'>The free will is not curbed in any way, for it follows directly
from the teleological purpose of prakṛti, which moves for the
experience and liberation of purusha. So this motive of
liberation, which is the basis of all good conduct, can never be
subordinated to the other impulse, which goads man towards
outgoing experiences. But, on the other hand, this original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>impulse which attracts man towards these ordinary experiences,
as it is due to the false knowledge which identifies
prakṛti with purusha, becomes itself subordinate and loses its
influence and power, when such events occur, which nullify
false knowledge by tending to produce a vision of the true
knowledge of the relation of prakṛti with purusha. Thus,
for example, if by the grace of God false knowledge (avidyā)
is removed, true knowledge at once dawns upon the mind and
all the afflictions lose their power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Free will and responsibility for action cease in those life-states
which are intended for suffering from actions only,
e.g. life-states of insects, etc.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>APPENDIX<br> <span class='c013'>SPHOṬAVĀDA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Another point to be noted in connection with the main
metaphysical theories of Patañjali is the Sphoṭa theory which
considers the relation of words with their ideas and the things
which they signify. Generally these three are not differentiated
one from the other, and we are not accustomed to
distinguish them from one another. Though distinct yet they
are often identified or taken in one act of thought, by a sort of
illusion. The nature of this illusory process comes to our view
when we consider the process of auditory perception of words.
Thus if we follow the <cite>Bhāshya</cite> as explained by Vijñāna
Bhikshu we find that by an effect of our organs of speech, the
letters are pronounced. This vocal sound is produced in the
mouth of the speaker from which place the sound moves in
aerial waves until it reaches the ear drum of the hearer, by
coming in contact with which it produces the audible sound
called dhvani (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, III. 17). The special modifications
of this dhvani are seen to be generated in the form of letters
(<i>varṇa</i>) and the general name for these modifications is nāda.
This sound as it exists in the stage of varṇas or letters is also
called varṇa. If we apply the word śabda or sound in the
most general sense, then we can say that this is the second
stage of sound moving towards word-cognition, the first stage
being that of its utterance in the mouth of the speaker.
The third stage of śabda is that in which the letters, for
example, g, au, and ḥ, of the word “gauḥ” are taken together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and the complete word-form “gauḥ” comes before our view.
The comprehension of this complete word-form is an attribute
of the mind and not of the sense of hearing. For the sense
of hearing senses the letter-forms of the sound one by one as
the particular letters are pronounced by the speaker and as
they approach the ear one by one in air-waves. But each
letter-form sound vanishes as it is generated, for the sense
of hearing has no power to hold them together and comprehend
the letter-forms as forming a complete word-form. The
ideation of this complete word-form in the mind is called
sphoṭa. It differs from the letter-form in this that it is a
complete, inseparable, and unified whole, devoid of any past,
and thus is quite unlike the letter-forms which die the next
moment after they originate. According to the system of
Patañjali as explained by the commentators, all significance
belongs to this sphoṭa-form and never to the letters pronounced
or heard. Letters when they are pronounced and
heard in a particular order serve to give rise to such complete
ideational word-images which possess some denotation and
connotation of meaning and are thus called “sphoṭas,” or that
which illuminates. These are essentially different in nature
from the sounds in letter-forms generated in the senses of
hearing which are momentary and evanescent and can never
be brought together to form one whole, have no meaning, and
have the sense of hearing as their seat.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Vaiśeshika view.</cite>—Saṅkara Miśra, however, holds that
this “sphoṭa” theory is absolutely unnecessary, for even the
supporters of sphoṭa agree that the sphoṭa stands conventionally
for the thing that it signifies; now if that be the
case what is the good of admitting sphoṭa at all? It is better
to say that the conventionality of names belongs to the letters
themselves, which by virtue of that can conjointly signify a
thing; and it is when you look at the letters from this aspect—their
unity with reference to their denotation of one thing—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>you call them a pada or name (<cite>Upaskāra</cite>, II. 2, 21). So
according to this view we find that there is no existence of a
different entity called “name” or “sphoṭa” which can be
distinguished from the letters coming in a definite order within
the range of the sense of hearing. The letters pronounced and
heard in a definite order are jointly called a name when they
denote a particular meaning or object.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Kumārila’s view</cite>:—Kumārila, the celebrated scholar of the
Mīmāṃsa school, also denies the sphoṭa theory and asserts
like the Vaiśeshika that the significance belongs to the letters
themselves and not to any special sphoṭa or name. To prove
this he first proves that the letter-forms are stable and eternal
and suffer no change on account of the differences in their modes
of accent and pronunciation. He then goes on to show that the
sphoṭa view only serves to increase the complexity without
any attendant advantage. Thus the objection that applies to
the so-called defect of the letter-denotation theory that the
letters cannot together denote a thing since they do not do it
individually, applies to the name-denotation of the sphoṭa
theory, since there also it is said that though there is no sphoṭa
or name corresponding to each letter yet the letters conjointly
give rise to a sphoṭa or complete name (<cite>Ślokavārttika</cite>, Sphoṭavāda,
śl. 91–93).</p>

<p class='c007'>The letters, however, are helped by their potencies (saṃskāras)
in denoting the object, or the meaning. The sphoṭa
theory has, according to Kumārila and Pārthasārathi, also to
admit this saṃskāra of the letters in the manifestation of the
name or the śabda-sphoṭa, whereas they only admit it as the
operating power of the letters in denoting the object or the
thing signified. Saṃskāras according to Kumārila are thus
admitted both by the sphoṭa theorists and the Kumārila
school of Mīmāṃsa, only with this difference that the
latter with its help can directly denote the object of the
signified, whereas the former have only to go a step
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>backwards in thinking their saṃskāra to give rise to the
name or the śabda-sphoṭa alone (<cite>Nyāyaratnākara</cite>, Sphoṭavāda,
śl. 104).</p>

<p class='c007'>Kumārila says that he takes great pains to prove the nullity
of the sphoṭa theory only because if the sphoṭa view be
accepted then it comes to the same thing as saying that words
and letters have no validity, so that all actions depending on
them also come to lose their validity (<cite>Ślokavārttika</cite>, Sphoṭavāda,
śl. 137).</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Prabhākara.</cite>—Prabhākara also holds the same view; for
according to him also the letters are pronounced in a definite
order; though when individually considered they are
momentary and evanescent, yet they maintain themselves
by their potency in the form of a pāda or name, and thus
signify an object. Thus Śāliknātha Miśra says in his <cite>Prakaraṇa
Pañcikā</cite>, p. 89: “It is reasonable to suppose that since
the later letters in a word are dependent upon the perception
of a preceding one some special change is wrought in the letters
themselves which leads to the comprehension of the meaning
of a word.... It cannot be proved either by perception or by
inference that there is any word apart from the letters; the
word has thus for its constituents the letters.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Śabara.</cite>—The views of Kamārila and Prahhākara thus
explicated are but elaborate explanations of the view of Śabara
who states the whole theory in a single line—<i>pūrvavarṇajanitasaṃskārasahito’ntyo
varṇaḥ pratyāyakaḥ</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The last letter together with the potency generated by
the preceding letters is the cause of significance.”</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Mahābhāshya and Kaiyaṭa.</cite>—After describing the view of
those who are antagonistic to the sphoṭa theory it is necessary
to mention the Vaiākaraṇa school which is in favour of it;
thus we find that in explaining the following passage of
Mahābhāshya,</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is then a word? It is that which being pronounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>one can understand specific objects such as those (cows) which
have tail, hoofs, horns, etc.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Kaiyata says: “The grammarians think that denotation
belongs to words, as distinct from letters which are pronounced,
for if each of the letters should denote the object, there
would be no need of pronouncing the succeeding letters....”</p>

<p class='c007'>The vaiyakaraṇas admit the significant force of names as
distinguished from letters. For if the significant force be attributed
to letters individually, then the first letter being quite
sufficient to signify the object, the utterance of other letters
becomes unnecessary; and according to this view if it is held
that each letter has the generating power, then also they
cannot do it simultaneously, since they are uttered one after
another. On the view of manifestation, also, since the letters
are manifested one after another, they cannot be collected
together in due order; if their existence in memory is sufficient,
then we should expect no difference of signification or meaning
by the change of order in the utterance of the letters; that is
“<i>sara</i>” ought to have the same meaning as “<i>rasa</i>.” So it
must be admitted that the power of signification belongs to
the sphoṭa as manifested by the nādas as has been described
in detail in <cite>Vākyapadīya</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the relation between the perceiving capacity and the
object of perception is a constant one so also is the relation
between the sphoṭa and the nāda as the manifested and the
manifestor (<cite>Vākyapadīya</cite> 98). Just as the image varies
corresponding to the variation of the reflector, as oil, water,
etc., so also the reflected or manifested image differs according
to the difference of the manifestor (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 100). Though
the manifestation of letters, propositions and names occurs at
one and the same time yet there seems to be a “before and
after” according to the “before and after” of the nāda
utterances (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 102). That which is produced through the
union and disunion (of nādas or dhvanis) is called sphoṭa,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>whereas other sound-perceptions arising from sounds are
called dhvanis (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 103). As by the movement of water
the image of a thing situated elsewhere also appears to adopt
the movement of the water and thus seems to move, so also
the sphoṭa, though unchanging in itself, yet appears to suffer
change in accordance with the change of nāda which manifests
it (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 49). As there are no parts of the letters themselves so
the letters also do not exist as parts of the name. There is
again no ultimate or real difference between names and
propositions (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 73). It is only in popular usage that they
are regarded as different. That which others regard as the
most important thing is regarded as false here, for propositions
only are here regarded as valid (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 74). Though the letters
which manifest names and propositions are altogether different
from them, yet their powers often appear as quite undifferentiated
from them (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 89). Thus when propositions are
manifested by the cause of the manifestation of propositions
they appear to consist of parts when they first appear before
the mind. Thus, though the pada-sphoṭa or the vākya-sphoṭa
does not really consist of parts, yet, as the powers of letters
cannot often be differentiated from them, they also appear
frequently to be made up of parts (<cite>Vāk.</cite> 91).</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Yoga View.</cite>—As to the relation of the letters to the
sphoṭa, Vācaspati says, in explaining the <cite>Bhāshya</cite>, that each
of the letters has the potentiality of manifesting endless
meanings, but none of them can do so individually; it is only
when the letter-form sounds are pronounced in succession by
one effort of speech that the individual letters by their own
particular contiguity or distance from one another can
manifest a complete word called the sphoṭa. Thus owing to
the variation of contiguity of distance by intervention from
other letter-form sounds any letter-form sound may manifest
any meaning or word; for the particular order and the
association of letter-form sounds depend upon the particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>output of energy required in uttering them. The sphoṭa is
thus a particular modification of buddhi, whereas the letter-form
sounds have their origin in the organ of speech when they
are uttered, and the sense of hearing when they are heard. It
is well to note here that the theory that the letters themselves
have endless potentiality and can manifest any word-sphoṭas,
according to their particular combinations and recombinations,
is quite in keeping with the main metaphysical
doctrine of the Pātañjala theory.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Vākya-sphoṭa.</cite>—What is said here of the letter-form sounds
and the śabda-sphoṭas also applies to the relation that the
śabda-sphoṭas bear to propositions or sentences. A word or
name does not stand alone; it always exists as combined with
other words in the form of a proposition. Thus the word
“tree” whenever it is pronounced carries with it the notion
of a verb “asti” or “exists,” and thereby demonstrates its
meaning. The single word “tree” without any reference to
any other word which can give it a propositional form has no
meaning. Knowledge of words always comes in propositional
forms; just as different letter-form sounds demonstrate by
their mutual collocation a single word or śabda-sphoṭa, so the
words also by their mutual combination or collocation demonstrate
judgmental or propositional significance or meaning.
As the letters themselves have no meaning so the words themselves
have also no meaning; it is only by placing them
side by side in a particular order that a meaning dawns in
the mind. When single words are pronounced they associate
other words with themselves and thus appear to signify a
meaning. But though a single word is sufficient by association
with other words to carry a meaning, yet sentences or
propositions should not be deemed unnecessary for they serve
to specialise that meaning (<i>niyamārthe anuvādaḥ</i>). Thus
“cooks” means that any subject makes something the object
of his cooking. The mention of the subject “Devadatta” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the object “rice” only specialises the subject and the object.
Though the analysis of a sentence into the words of which it is
constituted is as imaginary as the analysis of a word into the
letter-form sounds, it is generally done in order to get an
analytical view of the meaning of a sentence—an imaginary
division of it as into cases, verbs, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Abhihitānvayavada and Anvitābhidhānavāda.</i>—This reminds
us of the two very famous theories about the relation
of sentences to words, viz. the “Abhihitānvayavāda” and the
“Anvitābhidhānavāda.” The former means that words
themselves can express their separate meanings by the function
abhidhā or denotation; these are subsequently combined into
a sentence expressing one connected idea. The latter means
that words only express a meaning as parts of a sentence, and
as grammatically connected with each other; they only
express an action or something connected with action; in
“sāmānaya”, “bring the cow”—“gām” does not properly
mean “gotva” but “ānayanānvitagotva,” that is, the bovine
genus as connected with bringing. We cannot have a case of a
noun without some governing verb and vice versa—(Sarvadarśana-saṃgraha,
Cowell).</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>The Yoga point of view.</cite>—It will be seen that strictly
speaking the Yoga view does not agree with any one of these
views though it approaches nearer to the Anvitābhidhāna
view than to the Abhihitānvaya view. For according to the
Yoga view the idea of the sentence is the only true thing;
words only serve to manifest this idea but have themselves no
meaning. The division of a sentence into the component word-conceptions
is only an imaginary analysis—an afterthought.</p>

<p class='c007'><cite>Confusion the cause of verbal cognition.</cite>—According to
Patañjali’s view verbal cognition proceeds only from a
confusion of the letter-form sounds (which are perceived in
the sense of hearing), the śabda-sphoṭa which is manifested
in the buddhi, and the object which exists in the external
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>world. These three though altogether distinct from one another
yet appear to be unified on account of the saṅketa or sign, so
that the letter-form sounds, the śabda-sphoṭa, and the thing,
can never be distinguished from one another. Of course
knowledge can arise even in those cases where there is no
actual external object, simply by virtue of the manifesting
power of the letter-form sounds. This saṅketa is again defined
as the confusion of words and their meanings through memory,
so that it appears that what a word is, so is its denoted
object, and what a denoted word is, so is its object.
Convention is a manifestation of memory of the nature of
mutual confusion of words and their meanings. This object
is the same as this word, and this word is the same as this
object. Thus there is no actual unity of words and their
objects: such unity is imaginary and due to beginningless
tradition. This view may well be contrasted with Nyāya,
according to which the convention of works as signifying
objects is due to the will of God.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. It is indeed difficult to say what was the earliest conception of the
guṇas. But there is reason to believe, as I have said elsewhere, that guṇa
in its earliest acceptance meant qualities. It is very probable that as the
Sāṃkhya philosophy became more and more systematised it was realised
that there was no ultimate distinction between substance and qualities.
In consequence of such a view the guṇas which were originally regarded
as qualities began to be regarded as substantive entities and no contradiction
was felt. Bhikshu in many places describes the guṇas as substantive
entities (<i>dravya</i>) and their division into three classes as being due to the
presence of three kinds of class-characteristics. This would naturally mean
that within the same class there were many other differences which have not
been taken into account (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, II. 18). But it cannot be said that
the view that the guṇas are substantive entities and that there is no difference
between qualities and substances is regarded as a genuine Sāṃkhya view
even as early as Śaṅkara. See <cite>Ghābhāshya</cite>, XIV. 5.</p>

a charm when she was still a virgin. Being afraid of a public scandal she
floated the child in a stream; the child was picked up by the wife of a
carpenter (Rādhā). The boy grew up to be the great hero Karṇa and he
thought that he was the son of a carpenter until the fact of his royal lineage

<p class='c007'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. Purusha is a substance (<i>dravya</i>) because it has independent existence
(<i>anāśrita</i>) and has a measure (<i>vibhu parimāṇa</i>) of its own. So it always
possesses the common characteristics (<i>sāmānya guṇa</i>) of substances, contact
(<i>saṃyoga</i>), separation (<i>viyoga</i>) and number (<i>saṃkhyā</i>). Purusha cannot be
considered to be suffering change or impure on account of the possession of
the above common characteristics of all substances. <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, II. 17.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. “<cite>Tattvāntara-pariṇāma</cite>” means the evolution of a wholly new category
of existence. Thus the tanmātras are wholly different from the ego from
which they are produced. So the atoms are wholly different from the tanmātras
from which they are produced, for the latter, unlike the former, have
no sense-properties. In all combinations of atoms, there would arise thousands
of new qualities, but none of the products of the combination of atoms
can be called a tattvāntara, or a new category of existence since all these
qualities are the direct manifestations of the specific properties of the atoms.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, III. 52, says that the smallest indivisible part of a
thing is called a paramāṇu. Vijñāna Bhikshu in explaining it says that
paramāṇu here means guṇa, for if a thing say a stone is divided, then the
furthest limit of division is reached when we come to the indivisible guṇas.
But if the prakṛti is all-pervading (<i>vibhu</i>) how can the guṇas be atomic?
Bhikshu says (<cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, III. 52) in reply that there are some classes
of guṇas (e.g. those which produce mind <i>antaḥkaraṇa</i> and <i>ākāśa</i>) which
are all-pervading, while the others are all atomic. In Bhikshu’s interpretation
a moment is to be defined as the time which a guṇa entity takes to
change its own unit of space. Guṇas are thus equivalent to the Vaiśeshika
paramāṇus. Bhikshu, however, does not deny that there are no atoms of
earth, water, etc., but he says that where reference is not made to these atoms
but to guṇa atoms for the partless units of time can only be compared with
the partless guṇas. But Vācaspati does not make any comment here to
indicate that the smallest indivisible unit of matter should mean guṇas.
Moreover, <cite>Yoga-sūtra</cite>, I. 40, and <cite>Vyāsa-bhāshya</cite>, I. 45, speak of <i>paramāṇu</i>
and <i>aṇu</i> in the sense of earth-atoms, etc. Even Bhikshu does not maintain
that paramāṇu is used there in the sense of atomic guṇa entities. I
could not therefore accept Bhikshu’s interpretation that paramāṇu here
refers to guṇa. Paramāṇu may here be taken in the sense of material
atoms of earth, water, etc. The atoms (paramāṇu) here cannot be
absolutely partless, for it has two sides, prior (<i>pūrvadeśa</i>) and posterior
(<i>uttaradeśa</i>).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. Bhikshu regards the movement of a guṇa of its own unit of space as
the ultimate unit of time (<i>kshaṇa</i>). The whole world is nothing else but a
series of <i>kshaṇas</i>. This view differs from the Buddhist view that everything
is momentary in this that it does not admit of any other thing but the
<i>kshaṇas</i> (<i>na tu kskaṇātiriktaḥ kshaṇikaḥ padārthaḥ kaścidishyate taistu
kskaṇamātrasthāyyeva padārthaḥ ishyate</i>. <cite>Yoga-vārttika</cite>, III. 52).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. There is a difference of opinion as regards the meaning of the word
“<i>kshaṇapratiyogi</i>” in IV. 33. Vācaspati says that it means the growth
associated with a particular <i>kshaṇa</i> or moment (<i>kshaṇapracayāśraya</i>).
The word <i>pratiyogī</i> is interpreted by Vācaspati as related (<i>pratisambandhī</i>).
Bhikshu, however, gives a quite different meaning. He interprets <i>kshaṇa</i> as
“interval” and pratiyogī as “opposite of” (<i>virodhī</i>). So “<i>kshaṇapratiyogī</i>”
means with him “without any interval” or “continuous.” He holds
that the sūtra means that all change is continuous and not in succession.
There is according to his interpretation no interval between the cessation
of a previous character and the rise of a new one.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. Avidyā manifests itself in different forms: (1) as the afflictions
(<i>kleśa</i>) of asmitā (egoism), rāga (attachment), dvesha (antipathy) and
abhiniveśa (self-love); (2) as doubt and intellectual error; (3) as error of
sense. All these manifestations of avidyā are also the different forms of
viparyyaya or bhrama (error, illusion, mistake). This bhrama in Yoga is
the thinking of something as that which it is not (<i>anyathākhyāti</i>). Thus we
think the miserable worldly existence as pleasurable and attribute the
characteristics of prakṛti to purusha and vice versa. All afflictions are due
to this confusion and misjudgment, the roots of which stay in the buddhis
in all their transmigrations from one life to another. Sāṃkhya, however,
differs from Yoga and thinks that all error (<i>avidyā</i> or <i>bhrama</i>) is due only to
non-distinction between the true and the untrue. Thus non-distinction
(<i>aviveka</i>) between prakṛti and purusha is the cause of all our miserable
mundane existence. Avidyā and aviveka are thus synonymous with
Sāṃkhya.</p>
